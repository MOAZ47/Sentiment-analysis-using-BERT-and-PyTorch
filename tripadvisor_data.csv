“Very nice atmosphere”,"We were together with some friends at the Anewandter Hof. We took all 4 apartments, which enabled us privacy & piece. Apartments are fully equiped. Free use of sauna & whirlpool in the hotel was a bonus. Every morning there is a fresh bread waiting for us at the door. Great atmosphere, hospitable family Mairl and affordable price.",family,POS
"“Very nice food, great atmosphere, feels like home”","Martin and his staff are truely great! They make you feel at home. Their cheff does great things in the kitchen. We tasted a lot of dishes, prepared with quality ingredients. Our familyroom was nice with two separate bedrooms. The bathroom was small but our children had an extra sink in their bedroon so that was OK. The different bars (Stubes) our very cosy. A very nice place to stay!",family,POS
“Best Hotel on the Planet”,"We have stayed at the Excelsior on numerous occasions, both in summer and winter. Relaxation starts immediately, the second you walk in the door. The Call family and the staff are all wonderful and attentive to your every need. Kids are well catered for, allowing parents some precious quiet time together. The only hard thing to do here is leave! Spa and treatments are exceptional. Dining is exceptional and the outdoor lunch organized weekly is a highlight. Daily fitness events are well organized and prepared and there are secure parking facilities for bicycles (if you want to bring your own). We fully recommend this hotel and after many global travels feel that this is truly the best hotel on the planet. We know we will be back as soon as possible!",family,POS
“What a vacation should be”,"Having four days free in Milan, we decided to join some friends who were already vacationing at the Excelsior in St Vigilio. One couple was on their seventh visit to the resort and the other on their third, so we expected the hotel to be good. Our experience exceeded our expectations. Besides the fresh air and the gorgeous views that probably come with most any place in the Dolomites, at the Excelsior we were particularly impressed by the flawless service, their genuine hospitality, and the healthy and varied cuisine that included delicious vegetarian and gluten-free options. For dinner, besides the ample and fresh buffet, we chose our first course, main course, and dessert off a menu that we checked at breakfast.The menu had daily specials (sublime) and dietetic alternatives, such as simple grilled fish or grilled veal, consommé, etc. Our room was large and impeccably clean. It was divided into separate sleeping and living areas. A spacious balcony gave onto the valley below and the mountain peaks across. Hikes and bike tours are organized by the hotel. A barbecue picnic was also organized at a gorgeous spot in the forest next to a rambling stream. The more sporty guests could take a challenging hike to the picnic rendezvous accompanied by the hotel guide; the less physically fit could get there with the hotel van. We chose to hike on our own from a location about an hour from the picnic area. As the food was so good we overdid the eating so physical activity was a must. We used the spa facilities every day, mostly for the different saunas and the large outdoor whirlpool. The gym was small but sufficient and came with a beautiful view. For us, the Excelsior was the ideal place to rediscover a healthier lifestyle, enjoy the company of friends, and appreciate the natural beauty of the Dolomites. We look forward to returning.",friends,POS
“Excellent stay”,"In all aspects an excellent stay. Professional and friendly staff. Beautiful room and luxurious wellnessarea. Perfect meals, partly buffet and partly served. Hotel next to the slopes with a perfect connection with Kronplatz ski area. Room Tip: For a romantic stay choose room 210. This room has a fourposter. See more room tips",couple,POS
“OH Monika....the pinacle of Sesto”,"Located in the hamlet of Sexten / Sesto in far northeastern Italy, literally in the shadow of the Austrian / Italian border to the north and the mighty Dolomites to the south, this family run boutique hotel of 45 rooms has been one of my favorite hotels in the past couple of years. The hotel, staff, restaurant and spa deservedly earn my rating of a five, I don’t give out too many fives. I would have to say it all started before my brother-in-law and I even arrived for our “guys long weekend” of hiking and photography in the Dolomites when we were sent an email from Hotel Monika informing us that if we would like, the rooms we reserved were available the day before and we could come early with a discount. We took them up on their offer…. Arrival and check-in was a breeze….we presented ourselves to the reception desk and quickly ushered into the sitting area with a drink of our choice. By the time we were done, our bags were up in our rooms. John, my travel companion and I reserved two “single” rooms. These are smaller rooms with a single twin bed, a pullout sleeper sofa, and bathroom. Clean and nicely decorated. No balcony like the other rooms have, but quite frankly the only time we were in the rooms was to sleep. The other rooms in the hotel come in different shapes and sizes for couples to families. If they are anything like the “Single” rooms, they are mostly likely perfect. Common areas – bar, lounge, restaurant. There is a small bar and bigger lounge area where guests can mingle, drink, talk or stare into the central fire place. Two omissions – no smoking and no TV. I was a bit concerned being so close to Austria that smoking would be permitted, only outside…..I think as during our stay nobody smoked. The restaurant – Simply WOW. Not for the ambiance of an alpine dining room, but for the food. I’m not kidding. The meals here at the Monika have been superb. Because the hotel offers 3/4 board, breakfast, a late afternoon snack that is more like a lunch, and dinner is included in the room rate. We did not have a bad meal. Dinner, the highlight of the day is a five or six course meal – a set menu with limited choices of regional specialties. Vegetarians don’t worry as there are vegetarian dishes too. I jokingly told John that this is a gourmet restaurant with bedrooms. One would think that you would grow tired of eating at the same restaurant, but not here. In the evenings we would talk with our neighbors about the day’s activities, which hike did you do etc. It is very much of a family affair. Service in the restaurant is top notch along with the food. After a day or so, your wait person will know your likes and dislikes. Here is a tip – every day there are two wines recommendations – take them. Another highlight of the hotel is the spa and pool area. Do yourself a favor and book a spa treatment before you arrive as the spa maybe full on weekends. There is an indoor pool with an outdoor Jacuzzi. During the summer, you can lounge outside in the flower garden looking at the pinnacles of the nearby Dolomites. Also after a long day’s hike, take some time to soak up some hot and dry heat in their four different saunas. For the Americans coming here be forewarned that the spa area is a “naked” area for both men and women. After your first time in the spa, your shyness will fade as so will your sore muscles. So let’s talk about activities. While there are no real activities at the hotel, the hotel is located in the middle of sportsman’s paradise whether it be winter or summer, hiking or skiing, golf or even paragliding, the hotel will help you with arrangements and offer some discounts to some of the activities that there is a charge. John and I spent two days hiking and a day of lounging around the spa. An invitation to stay longer – one evening there was a note on my bed stating that the room is available if we would like to stay one more day longer – at a discount. Unfortunately John had to get back to home and his family; I on the other hand stayed for two extra days and more hiking. Check-out was a breeze. There are piggy banks at the reception for tips for the staff….next time I’m bringing my wife. I noticed that many of our fellow guests were return clients....there is a god reason for that.",friends,POS
“Escape To Hotel Monika”,"The TripAdvisor reviews aren’t wrong. Hotel Monika is the best choice in this area of Italy. If you like hiking, biking or just enjoying beautiful scenery, you won’t be disappointed. Our stay was seven days, and we chose full board, which included one of the best breakfasts of our 30-day Italy trip. Dinner was a five-course experience every night, and the wine list was very reasonable. Full board is a good choice here in Sesto as the dining choices are rather limited. Our superior hotel room was perfect save for low to the floor furnishings, which made sitting and reading a challenge. On the flip side our bathroom was likely the best of our 30-day adventure. The staff makes Monika very special indeed. From the maid to the front desk, all the servers, along with Alexander and the family of founders/owners, they all aim to please! In hindsight, three days would have been the perfect amount of time here rather than seven (unless your totally into hiking or biking), but you can't go wrong with Hotel Monika. Room Tip: Superior room in the newest section of the hotel. See more room tips",couple,POS
“Faultless in every way”,"It is not often that I give a hotel the maximum possible review and I would give it more if I could. The Monika is simply faultless. Alexander (owner) delivers a fantastic experience and has staff who are attentive, helpful and cannot do too much for you. The hotel is stunning, with beautiful bedrooms, bathrooms and public areas. The food, if not michelin starred already, should be, as it is simply fantastic. The 3/4 board option provides excellent value for money with you not wanting for anything. There is also no penny pinching whatsoever, with everything you could think of provided for your gastronomic pleasure. We only came for 3 nights but will certainly be back and are already planning our next visit. You MUST visit this hotel, it is simply fantastic!",couple,POS
“Third stay - still brilliant”,"This was a our third trip in three years to the Monika Hotel in Sesto. This is a great hotel in a wonderful setting. The hotel caters for your every need and is run by the Egarter family who make you feel very welcome along with all the staff. The food is wonderful at breakfast, dinner and afternoon snack. The rooms are spacious and fresh in an alpine style. There is a lovely indoor pool, outside jacuzzi and a great spa. The hotel is in walking distance of a cable car up to Mount St. Elmo and into the centre of Sesto where there are a few bars and restaurants. The hotel also has bikes which can be used for free. These have been upgraded recently but they are all quite large so I had to hire a smaller one nearby. The walking around Sesto is amazing. There are loads of clearly marked walks and trails and there are plenty of huts along the routes that serve food and lots of steins of beer and wine! The Unesco heritage site of Tre Cime is stunning and well worth a visit. San Candido is a bike ride or bus ride away which is beautiful. We will return!",couple,POS
“Wonderful - we were sorry to leave!”,"We chose to stay at the Hotel Monika after my husband completed the eight day Transalpine running race across the alps, from Germany through Austria finishing in Sexten. And what a perfect choice it was. The spa facilities, the grounds, the comfort of the room, and the excellence of the food, all contributed to a fantastic few days. The food was the highlight of our stay, in fact. Delicious breakfast (I loved the bread with fresh honeycomb and local fresh butter), the afternoon snack, and the beautifully presented and superbly cooked five course evening meals - unfailingly excellent. We stayed in one of the Pinus rooms on the top floor; great views, plenty of space, and extremely comfortable. The main languages in the area are Italian and German, so we particularly appreciated that the staff printed our detailed hotel information, and the daily dinner menu, in English for us. The staff are all friendly and helpful. My husband enjoyed some of the spa facilities, and we both made use of the swimming pool and whirlpool. Although we didn't take part, the free activity programme looked comprehensive and varied. The local public transport service is excellent, we used local buses on two days to get to fantastic walking/hiking routes. Hotel Monika thoroughly deserves its rating as the top hotel in Sexten. Thanks again to all the team for a wonderful stay.",family,POS
“One of my all time favorite places!”,"Hotel Monika was the highlight of our trip (couple with college age son) to Italy, Slovenia and Croatia. Outstanding spa (five types of sauna plus jacuzzi and pool) and complimentary tea/juice lounge and stunning outdoor lounge area. Spacious rooms decorated in a modern natural style with balconies. Incredibly gracious service. Breakfast, afternoon snack and five course evening meal were all gourmet, healthy and delicious. Many free programs which are nice especially if you are a single traveler.",family,POS
“Simply Stunning”,"This was our second visit to the Miramonti hotel, we visited the same time in Dec 2013. We said then we would probably not return as we could not better the experience.....Wrong! This hotel remains the best we have ever visited. To get there, we took a different route this time by flying into Innsbruck and then hiring a car. (Hertz were spot on.) We then took the A12 out of Innsbruck and drove through the Brenner pass (awesome views) down to Bolzano (it turns into the A22 further down), then on to Merano. It takes about 2 hours to get to Avelengo. You also go through three toll booths (paying at two) en-route. On arrival, we were greeted with a glass of ice cold Prosecco, which we had on the terrace while waiting for the room. The views were as stunning as the first time. We got re-acquainted with Marcello (a very fine waiter) from last year before going up to our room. This year, we were in room 407 (Loft room) which was as lovely as the first loft room we had (404). What keeps this hotel a superb place to visit is Klaus and Carmen and their outstanding team. We experienced the same attention to detail and lovely customer service as in 2013. Klaus and Carmen are, without doubt, two of the kindest people we have met and their staff reflects these values. We will be going back. Room Tip: Choose a loft room or the 007 room!

“ABOVE THE CLOUDS”,"We have been to Merano many times and know the Alto Adige well, but this experience was unexpectedly new. High up in the mountains after curving roads and a search through a tiny village and dark forests we found a heavenly place. We were greeted with a glass of prosecco which we enjoyed on the terrace while admiring the spectacular view into the valley. Our room was large with balcony and jacuzzi and all the amenities wanted for leisure time spent in the room. The hotel features a pool and spa, so the bath robes and slippers came in handy. The nature environment is repeated through the ecological appointment of the hotel inside: All natural fibers. The lobby features a blazing fire and comfortable chairs and sofas, newspapers, a bar, and helpful spirits will appear with coffee, tea or snacks. There is """"tea time"""" with cakes and fruits laid out in the dining room. Dining is a visual and palate pleasure: Excellent meals and good wine while viewing the city of Merano come to life with a million lights, a proper venue for our 50th wedding anniversary.",couple,POS
“Brilliant”,"This is our third visit, (11 nights) having been in 2008 and 2010. I think I said a lot then about it and it all still holds true. It isn’t cheap, but fantastic value for money. Visit the website for great pictures and visit the german site for panoramic views of the rooms and facilities. The staff are great, and we had great service from Petra, Antonio, Anna and Peter in the Restaurant. Yovannah and Manuel in the bar are great and worth watching the 2 of them working together. Katrin on Reception was extremely helpful especially when our Avis rental car broke down, she made some phone calls on our behalf. The menus are translated into English, which is good. The choice of food for Breakfast, Lunch (2.00 to 5.00) and then for Dinner is really good. You will not get bored with what is available. In some Hotels (especially in the UK) they give the same menu every night so after 2/3 nights you are stuck for what to choose. Not here because of the combination of choices available. The quality is superb. Our UK hotels could learn a lot from this hotel. We didn’t have any treatments, for fear of the language barrier. The owners don’t speak English and we only have a little German, but there is always someone around who will be able to help, especially the younger staff. We are just amazed that more Brits don’t visit this area. We will be back.",couple,POS
“Our best hotel experience ever”,"My wife and I have just returned to Norway after a five nights stay at Hotel Preidlhof. It was a dreamlike experience! Our spacious suite (Malve) had a terrace with whirlpool and sunbeds, the bathroom was luxurious, the room service was excellent with an abundance of clean towels and sheets for the sunbeds every morning. The food was excellent as well - very nice breakfast and lunch buffets and a delicious 7 course (!) dinner every night, all included in the room rate. We had our table decorated in different romantic ways at dinner every night. Very efficient waiters gave excellent service at every meal - almost no waiting for the different dishes. Drinks (both soft drinks and alcoholic beverages) were extremely expensive though, even by Norwegian standards. The spa and wellness area was a dream in itself: Everything was neat and clean, the spa suites were spacious and very romantic and the therapists professional and skilled literally to the tips of their fingers. We are definitely going back to Naturns and Hotel Preidlhof some time. This hotel is just perfect for a romantic holiday trip for couples!",couple,POS
“Good hotel but nothing special”,Nice suite! Spa was good except for the arrogant and cold receptionnist at the Spa! Food was not what you expect when you are in South tyrol....german chef sorry a no go! Hygiene on the buffet considering that this hotel is promoted as beeing a Babymoonhotel...no comment! The owner of the hotel did not greet as once...have never seen this before...I really do regret the nearly 4K euros we payed for 5 days. However the cleanliness of this hotel was exceptionnal.

“Absolutely PERFECT”,"I am not sure I can find enough superlatives to describe my 40 yrs anniversary in Hotel Dolce Vita Preidlhof, situated in a surprising beautiful province of Italy, with a positive mixture between Austrian methodical rigorous attitude and Italian exuberant intense spirit. I shall not repeat all the positive issues underlined in the previous reviews but only mention some more: Even if you already experienced the ‘Wellness Hotel’ concept, you will appreciate the style as well as the perfect arrangements of all the hotel’s facilities. For a romantic gateway or an anniversary, 3-4 days will be a good choice but if you would like to do some treatments (including sauna, gym, etc.) or explore the area and do some hiking or biking, then you will find a week might not be enough; anyway, in both cases you will wish a day could have 48 hours. Naturno is often described having plenty of sunshine days and good all year temperatures and it seems to be true as we had a wonderful weather. Swimming in the outside pool (34°C) and then relaxing in the sun was definitely not expected in February but fully enjoyed. Do not be concerned if you know only a few words in German or Italian, you will always find somebody from the staff to translate a brochure or provide you info in English; they are all very kind (including the Owners which are involved in the Hotel’s daily activities) and ready to surprise you with a large smile or a particular small gift. Some few words about the rooms and food: we asked for a suite and some room arrangements as it was a special occasion – worth every cent, surpassing any expectations. Breakfast is better than you can imagine and every dinner is a special one, you can choose from different courses, local and international fancy recipes, presented and served like in classy French restaurants, we often random ordered , as all the food was great. We left """"Preidlhof"""" concluding that we have to return sometimes.",couple,POS
“Perfect 10”,"Where do I start? First, I will say that I travel often for business and pleasure. I was looking for a place to escape and slow down for a week. I took a chance on Naturno, Italy, thinking I might be a little bored. What I found was that I never wanted to leave! The place is absolutely gorgeous and impeccably designed. Beautiful art is scattered throughout the property. Food, wine and service were fine dining quality. From the juicer in the mornings, to the loose leaf tea in the afternoons, ingredients were a delight for the culinary senses. All the staff, from the servers to the """"chief,"""" were friendly and accommodating to all my needs.",None,POS
“4-star deluxe”,"This hotel has everything that has been describedbin its brochure and more! Large, very modern, perfectly equipped rooms with all amenities you can imagine.

“Great Lindenhof!”,"I have stayed at Lindenhof Hotel for five nights in may. It's a very nice, stilish hotel just outside the lovely village of Naturno. It is tucked away in a little street off the main road which joins the villages through the Val Venosta up to Austria and Switzerland. In fact: it wasn't that easy to find it: the signs should perhaps be more frequent... A part from that detail i have nothing to complain about! As a a family we booked the Panorama Suite on the 5th floor: definitely breathtaking, extremely modern, all new and accurately well kept daily and of course very quiet. The restaurant is very nice: for the night of my birthday they arranged a special layout and gave me a nice llittle present. Food is very good, especially desserts. Breakfast is generous anc fresh. We also appreciated the spa: not as big as in other hotel i have stayed at but very functional. Our little girl (6 yrs old) was very pleased with Sabine, the girl in the baby club who played with her in the afternoons. I didn't quite like the inside swimming pool: i think it should be renewed and keep up with the level of the rest of the hotel. On the other hand, the outside pool is really pleasant and so is the """"feng shui"""" garden where you can read or relax in the sun. What else can i say: i found everybody very kind and accurate, from the waiters to the girls at the reception. They all speak italian without difficulty, which is not to be taken for granted in Alto Adige.... In the hotel there aren't many italians (at least, not at the time we were there) but mostly suiss and germans. I do recommend this hotel for a quiet, healthy family (or romantic!) holiday. I hope i'll have the opportunity to go back there soon!",family,NEG
“Simply the best”,"This is a one off: the best hotel / resort we know. Friendly staff, always helpfull and ready to assist. Perfect food and matching wines. Stunning location with countless opportunities for hiking, biking or just relaxing at the pool. Sauna and steambaths have to be seens to be believed. Interior is the perfect combination of modern design linked to alpine traditions: stone, iron, beautiful leather . Have visited the hotel a least once a year for over 8 years and are looking forward to this summer as we will spend once again our holidays at the Lindenhof.",family,POS
“Stunning in every way”,"Glorious setting, sensational food, superb staff and great facilities = a truly memorable experience. The mountain air and abundant outdoor activities help work up an outstanding appetite. But the ever helpful team at Lindenhof takes this into their stride by serving up an enormous quantity of super fresh, high quality food from dawn till dusk paired with a wine list that would shame many top end restaurants in a capital city. And in between all of that, the excellent spa facilities help to reset the aching limbs for the next adventure. Very impressed with the entire package and, yes, we will certainly be back.",couple,POS
“Carefree hotel”,"This year we stayed again for 2 weeks in July, and for the second but not ultimate time, at this exquisite 4stars superior hotel in Naturno (South Tirol). This place has excellent climat conditions and provides easy links by public transport with the neighbouring towns Merano and Bolzano. Hotel Lindenhof has a lot of trumps such as an exclusive ¾ gourmet-pension with a well-cared and varied gastronomic menu, an extensive offer of wellness facilities, free of charge: day nursery, garage, bikes, golf-car, internet link in the room, own guided mountain walks including pick-nick, a daily and weekly Newsletter, fitness, sauna, etc. And pets are also welcome. Our Italian designed Junior Suite was cosy and spacious with all expected facilities and has more than enough built-in cupboards. From the friendly owner-family Nischler we received always a warm welcoming. The family members are within easy reach to assist us where needed and do everything to please its customers. So do all the very attentive staff members who seem all very happy to be able to work in this hotel. I’ve stayed in many hotels all over the world.

“Wonderful! Highly Recommend!”,"My husband and I just spent three nights at the Hotel Grones and highly recommend it to anyone staying in the Dolomites. The hotel is immaculately clean, bright and very attractive both inside and outside. The staff (English speaking) could not have been more friendly and accommodating. The owners are on site and constantly checking to make sure that everything has been taken care of for you. Our original plan was to eat at the hotel only two nights but the food and service and ambience was so nice that we opted to eat there the third night also. We found the location to be perfect for walking into town. (Note: there is a somewhat steep path with steps to get to the """"strolling path"""" - we are seventy years old and in good health so it was not a problem for us.)

“Great view and food”,"The hotel has a excellent location overlooking maranza and the valley. It is near to 4 walking trails and the ski bus stop is in front of the hotel. Our Panoramasuite was big and comfortable. I gave only 4 stars for cleanliness because they did not clean the wooden floor (living and sleeping room) and bathroom floor everyday. It is great that our room does not have a carpet floor like most hotel but the down side is that one can see the dried prints and sand from the wet shoes and the leftovers from my dog's dinner. The food was great and there are enough choices for everyone from the 5 course dinner with salad buffet, 2 choices for appetizers, 2 or 3 choices for main course and 2 choices for dessert. There was always pasta or soup at 1pm and cakes at 3pm. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. The wellness and pool area and fitness room were clean and well-maintained. The sign for """"no kids allowed"""" on the door to the wellness area can be a bit bigger. I booked one of the wellness package for 1 1/2 hours in the morning and there happened to be a crying and screaming baby just outside the door. Although the massage and peeling were good but not at all relaxing. I did ask if it is normal for kids to be there and my massage therapist told me it is usually the italian families(?).

“GREAT WEEKEND IN EXCELLENT HOTEL !!!!!”,"We have chosen the hotel due to reviews published on Tripadvisor and we didn't regret it !!!!! We stayed at the hotel for a skiing weekend at the end of January. The hotel is situated in Gais, small, quiet village 5 km away from Brunico, 10 to 15 minutes from Kronplatz by car, and 5 to 10 minutes by car from the Brunico city center. Hotel has a main buliding and several other buildings in the same street - check it on the hotel website. We had a room on the second floor of the Landhouse which is 80 meters away from the main building - it was ok for us. The Landhouse has a garage and a slope's storage. The room was spacious, nicely decorated, warm and cosy with a nice sitting area - exactly like the one on hotel website. You'll find and umbrella and a bathrobes in the room, a small refridgerator, safety deposit box, and a TV. It is a quiet village, so it was perfect for a good night sleep. There are two types of pillows in the room so you can choose if you prefere a soft or a firm one. The bathroom was small with a bathtube, a bidet, a toilet, and a washbasin - it has a dark brown tiles and looks a little bit claustrophobic and this is my only objection: there are free soap, shower cap, and a liquid soap and shampoo in one, as well as a hairdryer and a radio. The room and the bathroom were spotlessly clean, towels could be changed on a daily bases if you need. We had a spacious balcony as well with a view to mountins. Reception, restaurant and a bar are in the main building. The food was really great, a variety of everything for breakfast, a soup, salads, sandwiches and pastries served from 2:30 till 5 pm, and a four course dinner from 7 pm: there is an aperitif, salads from a salad bar, warm appetizer, main dish, and a dessert for a dinner. We didn't go to a wellness or an indoor pool - those are in the adjacent building (just across the main building), but those looked ok on the website. I don't know how the internet works because we didn't use it, but there is a free wifi in the lobby in the main building where you can find a nice sitting area with several free magazines and newspapers for hotel guests. The stuff is warm, helpful and friendly: they made our stay at the hotel unforgettable, and we both felt sad when we had to leave. Special thanks to Slavisa, Ivan, Geza and Vito - they were really great and we felt like we're at home!!!! At the departure we got a small present, a bottle of spices that is great!!!! There is a garage behind the main building, as well as a free parking in front of the main building. We got a free a free weekly ticket for a bus that we'll take you to the different skiing places - the bus stop is just in front of the hotel entrance. And if you need something, there is a small supermarket, a deli shop and a sports shop in the same street as the hotel. This is really great hotel with excellent stuff and service, and I strongly reccomend the hotel - you'll not regret it if you choose the Windschar for your hotel in Brunico !!!",couple,POS

"“What a fantastic hotel, true hospitality you will find here!”","We stayed here this summer, our family with 4 children and our aupair. From the moment of arrival until the moment of departure it was great. The hotel is owned and managed by the family Kronbichler. This family is truly amazing, they know every guest by name ( a lot of returning guests and we understand why!) and from breakfast until the last drink in the bar you feelnthat they have it all under control. The hotel is located in Süd-Tirol and the mountains are fantastic to explore, even with young children. The city of Bruneck is close by and fantastic to just visit more then once, a very nice historic center with good quality restaurants and terraces. In the reception there is a binder with all kind of activities from young families to the more experienced hikers. The hotel facilities are very good, swimming pool and summer garden, spa with indoors swimming pool. Restaurant and bar have a good selection of food. When you stay like us for more then a week then you will choose half board. Every evening a great salad buffet with a lot of variation, the menu it self is also from a very good quality. We stayed in a large family suite with a terrace which was a very good choice. It is located 80 meters from the main house which for us was not a problem at all, actually it was quite nice. We can highly recommend this hotel to everyone! Thanks to the team of hotel Windschar we had a great summer holiday.",family,POS
“True hospitality & outstanding service!”,"We stayed with our friends for one night 18/2-19/2 and without any doubt this hotel is remarkable. The warm and personal welcome from Mr. and Mrs. Kronbichler and the eye for detail makes this hotel a very nice place to stay. The Kronbichlers and the staff are friendly, lending a helping hand without asking and the rooms and facilities are simply great. Nothing seems too much trouble. Food is very good, and the winelist extensive and reasonably priced. Yes, we will recommend this hotel to our friends and family!",family,POS
“Real gem”,"This is a real gem of a hotel. Everything about our experience was high quality. As soon as you arrive you realise you are in good care, with the indefatigable Frau Zemmer's very friendly welcome. I was particularly impressed that she knew the first names of all 5 members of our family without consulting any prompt on our arrival - it's not as if we were the only ones there. The hotel itself is located high up the hillside outside of Ortisei so the views are fantastic. If you like being away from the crowd then it is perfect. All aspects of the hotel are warm and comfortable. Our room was up at the top of the hotel sleeping all five of us. It was spotlessly clean and well-appointed. If I was going to make any observation it was that my bed was a little hard. The food was exceptional at both breakfast and dinner and the hotel was really accommodating with the kids' preferences. A nice personal touch is that each of the tables have the guests' name on them. Frau Zemmer is always happy to help and give useful tips on what to do. For those people who appreciate nice gardens, the rose garden at the back of the hotel is quite amazing. You can hire bikes for free at the hotel. Also make sure you get the free bus tickets from Frau Zemmer to take you down into Ortisei. Overall a lovely hotel and thoroughly relaxing and enjoyable stay.",family,POS
“Perfect in every way”,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The setting is stunning. The decor is absolutely charming. The bedrooms are really well appointed. Everywhere is spotlessly clean. And the food is excellent. But on top of all that the quality of hospitality is outstanding. The family are really welcoming and warm. Frau Zemmer in particular is always around ensuring that everything is perfect. The attention to detail is fabulous - including for instance a tree in the entrance hall bearing hearts with the hotel guests' names on. My daughter is vegetarian, and Frau Zemmer went to great trouble every day to discuss the evening's menu with my daughter to ensure that the set meal was adapted to suit her. On the festival of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, the family provided aperitifs and musical entertainment, which was delightful. Our whole stay was perfect. We were very sad to leave, and we hope to return. I would love to become a regular. If you want a bland international hotel with lots of nightlife, this is not for you.

“A little paradise in Dolomites”,This lovely 10-bedroom hotel is located above Ortisei and has wonderful mountain views. It is sutuated in the small quiet village of Bulla (Pufels) and run by the charming Zemmer family. The whole place is about tranquility. Rooms and bathrooms are well-appointed. Breakfast is very good and dinner (half-board only) superb. Wine list is short and very good. Not cheap but well worth it. Mrs Zemmer is a most pleasant and helpful person.

“One of the best”,"Perched high on the side of a ravine overlooking the town of Ortisei in Val Gardena is this oasis of peace and tranquility, disturbed only by the sound of sheep bells in the adjoining fields and the chimes of the numerous clocks scattered throughout the public rooms of this gem of a family run hotel. The Zemmer family have ensured that the needs of their guests are fully accommodated. The timber clad public rooms are delightfully decorated, whilst the modern pine clad bedrooms are very spacious, comfortable and quiet. In addition, the hotel is spotless and immaculately presented throughout. Dinner is a fixed menu (special diets are catered for), demonstrating the delicious highlights of the local cuisine, whilst the wine list showcases the best of the local producers. Over-seeing everything is the indefatigable Dunia, who, despite having a thousand and one other jobs to attend to, will always ensure that you get her prime attention. For garden lovers, the hotel hosts the highest rose garden in Europe, with over six thousand plants tended lovingly by Dunia's mother. For mountain walking enthusiasts, the hotel is ideally situated for access to the Alpe di Siusi, one of the largest mountain pastures in the Alps, covering many square miles, surrounded by mountain peaks and filled with Alpine flowers during the summer.

“For us simply the best!”,"This was our 5th time at Hotel Schwarzenstein and we still are more than 100% happy with this place...

For those with children I can only recommend this place. They have a great big playroom, everyday we practically had to drag our 3-year-old son from there. It is a very kid-friendly place, but also great getaway for romantic weekends. We were there with and without our kids and enjoyed both very much. CU soon Schwarzenstein!",family,POS

Great service """"everything is possible"""", very friendly, excellent food, a huge swinning and sauna area, all very clean.

You never have to rush to get a seat. Service in the restaurant as well as in the bar is fast, friendly and always great you. Especially Louisa and Slavo are doing a fantastic job. Too bad that the key person serving in the bar - Werner is gone. His replacement was the only disappointment this year. Skiing as well with the new runs in Speikboden was nice.

“Relaxing spot in the Alps”,"A very cozy spot in a quaint town. Hidden gem away from the more popular Alpine locations. This hotel is extremely close to the ski area that can be easily reached by car and/or free shuttle bus. It offers a lot of great alternatives to non-skiing guests. The pool area is very nice and the sauna is just brilliant. Nightly entertainment is also offered and each """"soiree"""" has a theme. Professional and courteous staff. Breakfast was amazing with marvelous local specialities. The rooms are very clean although there is not individual thermostat controls and they are kept very warm. The only minor issue was with the bathroom that is a little awkwardly designed and the shower floor was very slippery. Also we would have liked to see a little more toiletries available like hair conditioner and body lotion. This hotel surely contributed in making a nice vacation into a splendid one.",family,POS
“Modern luxury with old- fashioned hospitality.”,"Martin and his team made us feel instantly at home and offered us a choice of rooms showing us both. The room was quiet, large and airy with a clean modern shower/ basin area, comfortable beds and a good coffee machine. We had chocolates in the room and cakes in reception every day. The breakfasts were amazing. Delicious local cheeses with white truffle honey were among our favourites. Pupp cakes and pastries, rich golden eggs with crispy pancetta. All washed down with delicious coffee and a glass of prosecco and served by a lovely warm discreet lady. Great location in the cobbled pedestrian area of the town walkable from the station and right beside the restaurant and Xmas market area. We were given a Brixen Card which is invaluable. It gave us free travel up the mountain to the Plose area, free drinks in the cafe, free entrance to the Aquarena (well worth a visit for an evening soak and spa) and free train travel as far as Brenner. This, and the substantial breakfasts, made this hotel very good value indeed. Nothing was too much trouble in reception. We were given lots of information and Martin even picked us up some of our favourite honey so that we could take it home.",None,POS
“Perfect!”,"This hotel is absolutely perfect. Situated right on the slopes and still only 3-5 minutes walk away from the small and cosy village San Vigilio di Marebbe. The owners and the staff are wonderful - warm and friendly from morning to evening - even when our kids are being a little too loud. The atmosphere at the hotel is so nice, the rooms are big, light and clean and the whole wellness area is the perfect place to relax after a long day skiing in Plan de Corones. The food is plenty and very nice. The only suggestion from here would be to make the evening menu a little more """"simple"""" and italian but that is just a very minor detail - it can not change the overall impression of having had the best skiing holiday ever - we will definitely come back!.",family,POS
“English version of unanimous accolades!”,"My wife and 14 month old son stayed at Hotel Les Alpes for a week this summer. I had very high expectations, having read the many very positive reviews of this hotel when planning our vacation. We have also traveled to the Dolomites before, and we know the high quality of vacation and hotels in this region. Hotel Les Alpes did not disappoint in any way. As all of the other reviews in Italian and German say, this hotel is family-run, and it does feel like you are being welcomed into a family rather than checking into a hotel. However, the hotel has all of the luxuries that you could want, and the room was nice, new, clean, and quiet. Here are a few things the staff did to accommodate us: they cleaned our room at a specific time each day per our request to accommodate our child's nap schedule; they service for us and four our child at lunch and dinner was punctual, friendly, and professional, taking particular care to make sure our son had food to eat that he liked and could eat (at no extra charge); they found a way for us to do our laundry for free. The list could go on. The village is spectacular for active tourists. I never tired of the view of the Dolomites from our window. Maybe part of its charm is that we were the only English speakers at the hotel, which qualifies this hotel as a wonderful secret to American travelers in Italy.",family,POS

“The Lap of Luxury”,"We decided to spend a few days hiking the Dolomites in late October/early November on our way home to Calgary from Croatia, and we're delighted we did. San Vigilio was surprisingly the highlight of our trip. English is not widely spoken in the village, even among tourists, which only adds to its unique charm. By all accounts, the Excelsior is the premier resort/hotel in San Vigilio. When we arrived, the reception manager Patrizia greeted us like old friends and immediately offered us cake and libations before accompanying us to our room. Our room was large, well-appointed and comfortable with a stunning view of the valley and the bathroom was so clean it sparkled. The dining room staff were pleasant, efficient and professional (though somewhat taciturn), the bartender Remy was exuberant and always attentive and the food was DIVINE. All our meals, plus afternoon tea were included in our 3/4 board package and dinner time in particular was a riveting adventure. The food was exquisitely and elegantly prepared and guests were offered a dizzying assortment of delicious appetizers, salads and main courses. Even the salad bar offerings were entirely different every evening. The desserts were to die for. The resort owner Werner Call stopped at each table to chat with the guests every evening and directed us to some wonderful (and challenging) hiking trails at the nearby nature reserve. A lovely vacation from start to finish. I would surely stay here again on my next visit to northern Italy. Useful Tip: Rent your vehicle in Germany (say, Munich) rather than Italy. Cost savings for us were significant, about 1/4 the price quoted in Venice. Room Tip: Ask for an upper floor room in the new wing. See more room tips",couple,POS

Let me tell you, the family room that Petra put us in was absolutely perfect. One room for my wife and I and another with two beds for the kids..and surrounded by a huge balcony with views towards both town and the clock tower as well as towards the mountains. We went there with our usual plan of """"let's find someplace that looks interesting and figure things out from there"""", and in this regard Petra was a complete godsend as she basically laid out our daily plans for us based on the weather, our kids, and our interests and never once missed the mark. One thing I've learned over the years - trust the local who gives you a recommendation over a guide book every time. In addition, one of our bags was lost by United and/or Lufthansa somewhere on our way to Venice, but Petra dealt with the airlines in sorting out how to get us our luggage, which I will always be grateful for as trying to explain how to get to there in Italian would have been well beyond me. Thank you Petra so much for such a wonderful stay.",family,POS
“Perfect base for a visit to the Dolomites.”,"We wanted to fit a little mountain time into our three week tour of Italy, and we're glad we chose Castelrotto- and Haus Silbernagl in particular- as our base. I'm not sure whether my favourable impression of the Haus was shaded more by the fantastic mountain views from the balcony of our room, or by the fantastic presence of the owner/manager, Petra Silbernagl. Certainly, both were impressive! Petra is a wealth of knowledge on the area, sitting down with each group of guests at breakfast and providing information and maps on hike, drives, restaurants, or whatever you wanted to do. Our visit was in mid-May and spring was a little late this year, so her up to date info on which trails were still snow-covered, which lifts were running, and which alpine restaurants were open was invaluable. It was also great to come back to the Haus after a day of hiking and jump into the large indoor pool! The room itself was spacious and comfortable, in a mountain chalet style. Ours had a small balcony, perfect for sipping a glass of wine and enjoying the view. Castelrotto itself is a nice size for a stay of a few days, with enough restaurants and shops to keep you going, all within a short walk of the Haus. If a visit to the Dolomites is in your plans, I would highly recommend a stay at the Silbernagl.",couple,POS

Petra provided us with lots of local tips for hiking, ski lifts, restaurants, etc. and guided our drive to Venice through the Dolomite range! Thank you Petra! She had a well stocked refrigerator with drinks and wine for a fee. If you didn't know better, you would think you crossed the border. Gorgeous chalets, flowers, meadows, cows with big bells, and the beautiful mountains. We wished we could have ended our 3 week trip here because it was so relaxing.

The spa is top rate and your accomodations include use of the extensive steam rooms, pool and relaxation areas. The food could not be beat. A large selection of local food prepared by a chef who has been brought in from Southern Italy. The wine cellar is extensive. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful.

Our room surpassed our expectations, the quality of the bed was the best, seriously I have never had such a good sleep before. The other thing was the food. There were a great variety of dishes; for breakfast you could choose betwee several types of food. One negative thing is the athmosphere. If you come here as a foreigner, so without tour guides and """"knowledge"""" then you can hardly see any sights. Secondly, in the hotel we got cards with what we could enter only to our floor. There were stairs, but it was out of use sometimes. For example we decided to go on foot, because the lift was slow, and we didn't want to quene up, but the stairs were closed. (In that time when they should have been opened ( we knew its scheduled time) All in all it was a modern luxurious, relaxing holiday, so I recommend the hotel everyone who is on a business trip or want to see a secret part of Italy.

Dinner at restaurant was exceptional, with creative menu items. For simpler fare, bar serves burgers, etc. Breakfast buffet was respectable: good selection of deli meats, cheese, well-cooked bacon, sausages, pastries, cereal, yogurt, etc. Scrambled eggs were under-cooked, and no pancakes, if that''s your thing.

Reception gladly makes some rearrangements with our room reservation before our arrival and several rooms was prepared by our announcement before the check-in time.

We had several different rooms - Family Suite with enough place for 3 adults, as well Suite Superiore and normal double and panorama double rooms - all of thouse was excellent and really cosy. Some of friends pointed extra that beds were excellent - good sleeptime for sporty days! There was a sauna but we hadn't time to enjoy that. Breakfast was tasty, bar open 24h to chat with friends in more convenient atmosphare. Village is close enough even to walk which is actually important because in there is sometimes little complicated with taxis in nighttimes.

“Fit for a Prince of the Church”,"Brixen/Bressanone completed my tour of Sudtirol. It's a lovely historic town (like a miniature Salzburg-with which it has many parallels and historic connections). Brixen was the favourite holiday retreat of then- Cardinal Ratzinger, and this hotel was where he habitually stayed. It is extremely comfortable, situated in a wonderful old building (characterful old fixtures and fittings, and interesting paintings), with a large walled garden over the road, (where the pool, and the wellness centre are). It's right in the heart of Brixen (which is not that large, so everything is within easy walking distance). The restaurant is traditional, cosy and with excellent food and wines (and serving local dishes). Breakfast was v good. Staff in all parts if the hotel were all v welcoming, and speak perfect English. It's an extremely old hotel, and the name comes from a 16thC elephant called Hanno, who was gifted from King Jao III of Portugal, to the then Archduke Maximilian of Austria. Hanno had to walk all the way to his new home, and he stopped off for a few weeks at the medieval hostelry which is now this hotel. (He eventually made it.

A swish stylish hotel, great room on the ground floor, no need for the deluxe option. Light bright, warm, and extremely comfortable, and lots of delicious little extras. I ate in both the intimate Stube and twice in the 1500. Service and food in both was excellent, the sommelier/waiter chose wisely and realistically from a fabulous wine list. Breakfast is opulent, a great way to start days of leisurely hiking. Two doors from my room was the spa, again excellent, luxurious, relaxing and indulgent. Indoor/outdoor pool warm and inviting. Massage service was professional and relaxing. A selection of teas and tisanes in the lobby with crackling log fire, a well stocked library.

“Stayed only 1 night but very impressed!”,"We stayed at Hotel Cristallo for only one night in August but I was very impressed by the hotel in that short period of time. The hotel and rooms are modern, comfortable, clean and very spacious (by Italian standards). The staff was extremely professional and friendly and went out of their way to assist us. My husband's luggage broke and we went to the front desk to ask if we could borrow some tools so he could fix it and they loaned us some basic tools which was very nice. Then, I couldn't figure out how to turn the heat on in our room and inquired at the front desk. Being that it was August, they don't normally heat the rooms however being from Southern California, I was cold at night and they accommodated my request and had someone turn on the heat in our room! We also needed to purchase a specific item and the front desk staff were very helpful in directing us to a store where they thought we could find the item (which we did). Upon checking out, we were also given a jar of preserves which I thought was a nice touch. The staff went above and beyond in my opinion. I also solicited advice from the person at the front desk about a driving route that would maximize photo opportunities and she gave me advice which worked out very well. We ate dinner and breakfast at the hotel and both were superb. The dinner was outstanding and the night we were there they had a dessert buffet the likes of which I've never seen! Everything was artfully and beautifully displayed and everyone was taking pictures of the dessert spread because it was so nice. Breakfast was equally as good with a large selection of items. I wish we had been able to stay longer as the Dolomites area is really lovely and this hotel would make a nice base from which to explore the area.

The resort is nicely located at the entrance of the picturesque Fiscalina Valley, with easy access to the Croda Rossa cable car right behind the resort. A breeze 20 min. walk via lovely forest trails can reach Sesto, or in opposite direction, upstream to Talschlußhütte Hut, where you can enjoy the breathtaking views of the nearby mountains while having your coffee or lunch. This hut would be your ideal base to explore the exciting hiking paths in Sesto Dolomites including the one leading to the Three Peaks “Tre Cime di Lavaredo”. The top Suite GALLO CEDRONE we stayed was very spacious (with one bedroom and one living room with a double sofa bed) to easily accommodate our whole family with 2 adults and 2 children. Room and wellness facilities were also superb and well maintained. Half board is highly recommended here, as the food is simply GREAT!!!

We took a massage and bath in a wooden bathtub and we think, the treatments aren't the best. The staff and service is good and friendly. The rooms are big, quiet and nice. Breakfast and dinner is good, but not very special. The dinning room is very well designed to get your part of privacy.

“why flying from americas to val badia?”,"this is the question i asked myself when i saw people from all around the world (south america, US Canada etc) staying in this hotel. this was a silly question though. val badia is a magic place with immaculate landscapes and great slopes. not to mention the few michelin stars restaurants in a 10 km area. this hotel represents exactly what val badia is. great hospitality (the one lady show silvana, the maitre giacomo , the sommelier daniele , the bell boys etc just to mention few of the nice and highly professional people working at the hotel), very good food and a nice spa. all of this in a great setting with the dolomites surrounding the hotel. the shuttle service to the centre of the town and to the slopes is impeccable (last time i had something similar was at 4 seasons hotel in vail). the bar is cosy and so two rooms of the restaurant area ( out of three). the family who owns the place manages it like if it was their house and so there is an extreme attention to details and to guests needs. the rooms are spacious and intimate. yes it is not a 5 stars luxury and some improvement could be made (inside boutique/shop also for sky rental and maybe a fast track for booking local sky instructors) but really this place is something which i advise to go. we spent 8 days spent there but wanted to have more. will be back for sure. ps. a bit of trivia. how can guests understand the hotel has been upgraded? bathroom towels still show a 4stars rating",family,POS

The Hotel staff are well informed and very helpful about the town, the hiking, bus transportation, and just about anything else you'd like to know. Castelrotto is a quiet little town, and everything shuts down in the early evening. It is safe and charming --- be sure to check out the cemetary behind the main church. Each grave is tended by local people and has growing plants and shrubs and a photo of the person who died. At night, candles are lit on each grave. It is obviously an important part of village life.

After a day of skiing you would think they would expect their guests to need to dry their clothes, I was lucky to get one of these rooms but be careful, you do NOT want rooms 2-3 and 4-5 like my friend. These rooms are joined with 6 people on each pair of rooms but only one bathroom and you might end up sharing it with a complete stranger. But these are only two pairs of rooms from the entire hotel. The food is excellent and in plenty for large groups, including wood-oven baked pizza. The WiFi is absolutely atrocious, unfortunately. They claim that it is in the entire hotel while it is almost impossible to catch anywhere than the common room where it has sporadic moments of working and not and sometimes goes down completely for the whole night. The staff is kind enough to let you connect via cable if you request it. The hotel offered a well working ski-boot dryer and close to Brunico and well situated.

Nevertheless this palce consists of 2 """"Pensions"""" (guesthouses) and 1 Appartmenthouse and the old illuminated mansion on most web pages should make you believe that you also stay inside of this building - you won't as this is the restaurant only.... We had a BOOKING.com day-at-arrival reservation for 58 EUR/night and were guided to Pension Schönblick.

And the hiking is amazing, with a fantastic hut system that allows you to hike for a few hours with unparalleled scenery, but never be more than a 45 minute walk from beer on tap!) Our B/B accomodations were about 80 Euros per night, which seemed like a good deal. The rooms in the building in which we stayed (and I think all of the doubles) were pretty small, and the bathrooms were REALLY small. But, there was enough room to do what one needed to do fairly comfortably, if not luxuriosly, and everything was very clean.

Anyway, since it was just one day we cleaned up the room ourselves and just like they intended we 'just bear up' for that night. This place is more suitable for those that come in Camper Vans and camp as by evening the whole place is full of them walking around the lobby area in their undies and smelly clothes.

Wellness and activities are very attractive here, indoor and outdoor pool, a good selection of different saunas, hot tubs, fitness room, cosmetic and beauty treatments, tennis courts, tennis courses are free of charge - and all of it in an extremely pleasant, clean and well presented environment. The hotel is the perfect base for a hiking holiday. Once a week the owner's mother takes guests on guided tours in the mountains, but this is more entertainment than stoic walking for hours on end (loved the break in the little pub up in the mountains + the red wine). The breakfast in Hotel Taushof consists of a large hot and cold buffet, including freshly cooked eggs and bacon, variety of cerials, fruit and yoghurts. Lunch is often a smaller pasta, pizza, soup and salad selection - as the majority of guests is usually out for the day. Evening meals consists of 6 - 8 (!) courses, the chefs in the hotel have won national and international awards for their creations. During the summer period, the hotel offers a kids club, my children enjoyed this a lot, especially since they have their own party hut now where they are kept active and entertained. Klaus and Uschi Pfoestl (the owners) and their team have always been fantastic hosts and just could not do enough for us. I cannot wait to return some time later this year (I hope).",family,POS
“Incredible summer holiday”,"This is the kind of place that you want to keep to yourself, on the other hand it deserves 5/5!! It has large and modern apartments with gorgeous views, but the exceptional staff goes above and beyond. It's a 5 minute walk down the hill to the pedestrian area of San Cassiano but being up the hill means incredible views. The Val Badia is gorgeous and there is so much to see and do that in 7 days we felt like we scratched the surface. I will definitely go back to Ciasa Antersies!

The apartment was spacious and well appointed, secure parking in the garage, incredibly helpful and friendly staff, nothing was too much trouble. Located at the top of the village the hill to the apartment proved tough after our marathon cycling event! There are some good restaurants and bars nearby and the views are stunning. Highly recommended. Room Tip: Try to get a room at the front of the hotel and take in the stunning views. See more room tips",friends,POS
“Très bel endroit - a very nice place”,"A very nice place in Dolomites. On the upper part of San Cassiano village; the sight seeing form the appartment is wonderful. The appartments are really pretty and quite large. They are well equiped. The place was an hotel before renting appartments and they have kept a quality of service of an hotel (every day: change of towels if you want, removal of garbages, making your bed, etc.). They can provide you breakfast in your room. The people in charge are really very kind and friendly. My only concern was with the noisy guys in the apparment close to ours. The walls are may be a little too thin for unfair neighbors... Excellent place with many possibilities for trekking or hiking.",couple,POS

“Unexpected surprise”,"We arrived here later than planned after driving down from Salzburg, and were too late to go over the pass to Obergurgl/Solden. We wandered around this small town and checked out a couple of places before we found the Stroblhof. It was Saturday evening, about 7pm, and the manager offered us a very attractive 100 euro (for 2), including breakfast. This was significantly less than the published rate and we grabbed it .... great move! Large comfortable bedroom suite, nice dining room with great staff (our waitress spoke no English and my German is definitely limited, so we ended up selecting dinner based on barnyard sounds!), complete breakfast with omelette station, and best of all, the most incredible indoor pool and spa area, which we had almost to ourselves before breakfast.

Dinner is not à la carte, you can choose between a few things on the daily changing menu ( 18 euro pro person for soup, starter, main course and dessert) and the food was really good. The breakfast was hughe with a chef who bakes your eggs upon desire!

I really can recommend this hotel for people without or with kids!",couple,POS
“Never again”,"A friend and I stayed at the Stroblhof one week in June 2006 in order to relax and to play golf. Our rooms were big and clean, and we mostly experienced the staff as helpful. As a hotel guest, you have access to a variety of leisure activities like hiking or riding organised by the hotel or at least in cooperation with the hotel. Strong downsides were the nosy place, the hotel is located on the main pass route, and the unenjoyable food, the dessert is an exception. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our stay mainly thanks to the great golf course and the fantastic scenery.",friends,NEG

"“Gorgeous, elegant, relaxing, warm!!! Don’t search more, choose Schweigl!”","Imagine elegant and very warm stylish hotel. From the lobby you smell sauna woods heated. From the entrance you get a feeling of living home, but it sounds quiet and relaxing. There is a playroom for kids, but even they are there, it’s very quiet. The rooms look and feel brand new and VERY elegant. All bathroom equipment is brand new and kept extremely clean. Warm floors in bathroom and very indulging shower. Every detail prepared with care of comfort: beds, sheets, pillows, closets, balcony view, lamps…. all to make your stay to feel at home but on relaxing vacation. The sauna also organized in very relaxing way and was not too crowded to my surprise. The breakfast is generous and of good quality. They serve a dinner if you choose so, but we didn’t try it since it was too early for us (19:00). I’m sure it should be delicious and given by a very good price : 15 EUR for person (including salad bar, first dish, main dish and desert) – that’s not expensive at all, comparing to restaurants in the area. The area is also very beautiful, even though we were there at not best season – beginning of march- so the snow was dirty but it was still cool at nights. We could appreciate that the lake must be amazing at summer but we had enough snow even at march to do ski. The personnel and owners are very friendly and responsive. We get everything we asked. In addition they do workshops for beautiful handmade things from wool. You can see those flowers and vases in their picture gallery and buy them as perfect souvenir. We had a wonderful vacation thanks to Schweigl!!! Room Tip: i'm sure all rooms are perfect. See more room tips",couple,POS
"“Nice apartments, great location”","Stayed here over the Christmas period. Apartment was spotless, very well equipped, brand new. Nice views out over the frozen lake, ice-skating, horses (they belong to the Schweigl which has stables and offers pony rides etc). This hotel is in Pracupola, which is the part of S. Valburga where the ski lift starts. Nice being able to walk down to the ski lift, so we used our car very little. The cross country piste also passes in front of the hotel, though depending on the snow coverage it might only be open from S. Nicolo upwards (3 mins drive further up the valley). There is a shop in Pracupola for basic food. Regular buses run from in front of the hotel down to Merano. Beds were comfortable, apartment was very quiet. We enjoyed having a bar within walking distance of the hotel on the main road, which also serves food. All in all a good stay though the owners seem better disposed towards their German guests and this was a little disappointing and very different to other places we've stayed in the valley. We were also surprised that no information about surrounding attractions, walks, services etc was available in Italian (or any other language except German) in reception.",family,NEG
"“Wonderful stay in Corvara, I wish it was longer”","We loved Sporthotel Panorama for their lovely staff, gorgeous location and Chocky the Labrador (and the food and jacuzzi!). The staff made us feel so welcome and never raised an eyebrow to our repeated visits to the buffets or cheese board. The hotel's reputation for good food is very well deserved. I originally booked B&B through Colletts but they recommended half board and we were so glad for the advice. The hotel is a 15 min hard walk up a steep hill from the village, which is a killer after a 5 hour hike, but worth the effort. We were usually greeted at the end of the day by the gorgeous Chocky wanting a tummy rub and we then limped to the fabulous wellness centre with jacuzzi, saunas, steam room, swimming pool. Massages can be booked at a reasonable cost. For those visiting with Colletts, Chalet Angelo is next door so office hour is an easy commute. Reception put visitors who want to play tennis in touch with each other and if the weather is bad, it is possible to reserve a covered court in the village which has a fabulous mountain view from every window. Walking around Corvara is extensive, varied, staggeringly beautiful and very well way marked.

"“A Disappointment! Not Relaxing, not 5 Star to Us”","The hotel's brochure reads: """"Weinegg: Wellness Hotel, Gourmet & Relax"""". That sounded promising as did the fact that the German National Football Team chose this hotel during its preparation for the 2010 World Championships. Afterall, they could stay anywhere and chose this hotel...Well, we were sorely disappointed. Our first impression was that no one was available to help us with our bags. And this at a 5 star hotel? When we were shown to our 2nd floor room, we were overcome by how hot it was. (It was August and high temperatures are normal, but should not be in the rooms.) Naturally, we expressed our concern and were shown the A/C in the adjacent room which had not yet been turned on. (Obviously, to save energy at the discomfort of the guests!) To our further dismay, the fully inadequate appliance didn't have enough power to reach from the sitting area/balcony to the bedroom and bathroom. It remained unbearably hot. (I measured 28* C.) And the beds were equipped with down comforters, not the lightweight ones for Summer! As the situation did not improve, we requested help from the Front Desk. No apologies, just the suggestion that a fan could be brought up. Even after setting that noisy relic up, it remained uncomfortably hot and we all slept poorly. The situation remained bad for the 3 nights of our stay. Minus points all the way around. In addition, the room was a bit run down and un-modern: the pink flowered tiled bathroom boasted thin towels where make-up stains remained and a main light fixture was not working and the sofa/pull-out sleeper in the reading area had been re-upholstered in a cheap vinyl. And although the the spacious pool area with the 'sand beach' looked so inviting, the 'beach' was only a small strip of sand and the chairs near it were always 'claimed' by a few families who put towels and beach bags on the chairs before breakfast and returned later on. Frustrating! And the commotion from the lively, unattended children! They had taken over the pool areas and the grassy areas where the lounges were. Relaxation was not possible. This is definitely a FAMILY hotel and not a Gourmet & Relax Spa Hotel for adults. What we remember of the food in the main restaurant was that it was passable, but the dining room was also full of children and chaotic. We preferred sitting outside near the pool in the alternative restaurant. That was nice: under the stars with a breeze blowing, a nice glass of wine and acceptable food. Also annoying was the situation at breakfast. The tables were assigned to specific rooms. That meant a table was reserved for that party for the duration of their stay. And it remained empty if they decided to come later or not at all. What that meant for us was that we ended up sitting at an aisle table near the entrance to the dining hall and the clean-up station away from the view for our entire stay. And we weren't paying a discount price! What we did enjoy was renting out the E-bikes and exploring the Wine Route. Perfect for making stops and tackling the hilly bike paths. The hotel is situated in vineyards and orchards-green all around--but not practical for letting out our dog. There were signs up near the hotel showing that dogs were forbidden on the green spaces. We had to walk further away from the hotel for suitable spaces to let her out. All in all, we do not intend on returning here and do not recommend this hotel to anyone who does not have children and/or a thick skin.",couple,NEG
“Relaxing Weekend”,"After several weeks of pressure we decided to take a break and we decided to spend a Weekend in a relaxing atmosfere. Weinegg hotel demostrated a perfect choice.

The management upgraded us to a bigger suite when they realized that we could be not too confortable in our reserved room, all the staff treated us really warmly with the almost full board including breakfast, dinner and also light lunch. Food was good, tasty and appropriate for an healthy weekend. The room was confortable and modern with a TV offering free internet connection. The hotel welcomed us with a bottle of Prosecco and friut and let us have chocolate every nights. Wellness area is not too big but is comprehensive of all you need and masseurs are reaaly skilled and let you have wonderful experience. In addition the surroundings are impressive full of vineyards, apple trees. Wineries are at the best level in Italy and they really closed and available to serve you with free wine tasting. If you want to have some trekking or biking, the hotel will offer you really technological mountain bike to see the wonderfull hills and the nearby lakes that we some of the most charming in all Italy.

The buffet alone could’ve made a meal. Breakfast was also abundant with breads, cereals, fish, and cheeses. Spacious room and bath--all very comfortable. Great location for trails.

“Treat yourself and don't look anywhere else”,"My husband and I stayed in Hotel Icaro on the last 8 days of March. Email exchange with Angelica Sattler was efficient. Check-in with Anna went really smooth. We were assigned room 207 facing east, the Langkofel and Plattkofel, enjoying a different sunrise everyday because of the effects of snow or clouds or the absence of it. Can't beat the location. It's on the piste/run (chairlifts: Monte Piz and Sanon). I wasn't feeling very well on the first day. Got the chills! Mrs. Sattler sent a portable electric heater to the room. Now, that's service! Room: Very clean! Bed is big enough (my husband is 1.95 meter tall). We ordered special pillows at the reception (extra service). Slept like babies every night. Shower has a large spout with """"massage"""" functions. Bathrobe, towels and slippers for the sauna; and bathroom amenities are provided for. We only turned on the Samsung TV when we wanted background music (MTV) while dressing up... Because why would you want to watch TV if you have a million dollar view just outside your window? Bedroom is on the small""""ish"""" side. That's why I gave it 4 points instead of 5. Food and beverage: There's a lot of choices during breakfast. Different kinds of bread, cheeses, cold meat cuts, eggs, cakes, croissants, fruit salad, cereals, yoghurt, fruit juices, milk, tea, coffee. You can make your own fresh orange juice, too. Dinner is always 5 courses except during Sundays (gala evening - 6 courses). Food is amazing and the wine suggestions are spot on. Wine menu is extensive. Tip: I love their ginger/ingwer tea after skiing!!! Sauna and Wellness: My husband and I got massages from Brigitte twice. It was wonderful! You should try it. And the massage bed was lovely. It gives you the illusion of lying on warm water (with ripples and waves) without getting wet. I visited the sauna just once bacause I always fell asleep in the room after skiing. But my husband loved it and went everyday. There's a Finnish sauna, infrared cabin, biosauna, Turkish bath, hay room, relax zone with really cool hanging nests. They provide free tea, apples and water. And everything was always clean! I didn't visit the area with whirlpool and swimming pool. Tours: We took the Alpe di Siusi - Val Gardena tour with Mr. Walter Sattler. My husband has a medical condition that made it almost impossible for him to finish the tour. We had to cut it short. Walter was patient with my husband, showing sympathy and understanding. The guided winter walk with Brigitte was very enjoyable. I loved hearing stories about the witches, and about a prince who wanted to go to the moon. :-) The Sella Ronda tour with Walter was incredibly beautiful. Being Asian, I wasn't born with skis under my feet. Having done the Sella Ronda is quite an achievement. Walter is a very good guide. I wish I could speak German better because I hated missing some things that were being said during the tour. Thank you Roman, Magda, Retish, the small blond lady with glasses, the chef and her kitchen crew for making our dining experience very pleasant. Thank you dark-haired lady who always made sure our room was clean and our bed made up before we came back from skiing. Thank you Brigitte for the invigorating massages.

“Wonderful hotel in secluded valley”,"My family and I had one of our most memorable and wonderful holidays ever at the Golden Rose Hotel. Paul, his wife and his team were very warm and welcoming and the dinners in the restaurant were simply fantastic. The recommended wines never failed to impress. The highlight of our stay was surely the barbecue in the backyard - fresh seafood and meat grilled on the spot - very convival and festive. Rooms were beautiful, cozy and thoughtfully decorated, full of local character but never kitsch. It's also easy to access various hiking trails from the hotel, many of which lead to mountain huts and cafes that offer astounding views of the Alps and the high alpine meadows as well as delicious, hearty food. The village of Karthaus where the hotel is located is a peaceful and friendly place, with picturesque chalets and the ruins of an old monastary. We spent a night in the Bella Vista mountain hut, which again was beautifully decorated and served the most delicious pasta and apple pie. Waking up in the middle of the night to see the moon shining over snow-clad mountains is something we'd never forget. The nearby town of Merano, accessible by an excellent rural public transport network, is elegant, vibrant and full of interesting sights. We loved our stay at the Golden Rose Hotel and can't wait to go back again. In fact, we were quite reluctant to share on Trip Advisor just how much we loved it - because so much of its charms comes from the feeling that you're staying in an undiscovered paradise.",family,POS

Having stayed in both of these properties at least 10 times it really time to write a review. The Golden Rose offers uniquely furnished rooms with antique furniture and bathrooms in modern Italian design (philipp starck bathroom sinks) The food at the hotel is more then you can wish for.

“Very nice but not outstanding enough to justify the cost”,"The Seiser Alm Urthaler is a lovely hotel in a spectacular location, but I can’t quite give it rave reviews. We arrived at 21:30 on a Friday evening, half an hour after the kitchen closed. We had notified the hotel personnel that we would be getting in late, and they said they’d save us some food. They did bring us a platter of appetizers, which were very good, but it seemed a bit skimpy considering that we were paying for a four-course dinner (half board is mandatory). I don’t think a five-star hotel necessarily has to have 24-hour room service, but how hard would it have been to warm up a bowl of soup and add a dessert to make it feel like we were getting our money’s worth? Or offer a token discount to acknowledge the fact that they’re saving money by not feeding us dinner? It seems a bit unreasonable to expect all guests to get in early on their day of arrival. We were in Alpe di Siusi to cross-country ski for the weekend (the trails are fabulous!), and when I asked if it would be possible to keep the room a couple of hours past the standard check-out time on Sunday so we could shower after skiing, the woman at reception said it would cost 35 euros per person. Now, I can understand charging if the hotel needs to arrange for overtime housekeeping (although even then 70 euros seems a bit steep), but the woman admitted that it was the end of the season and the room wouldn’t be needed that night (she started to ask my room number and then said, “Oh, it doesn’t matter because no one is coming tonight anyway”). So there was no reason they couldn’t simply have cleaned the room the next morning. If you’re a hotel manager and you have the opportunity to do something nice for your guests that will cost you absolutely nothing, why on earth wouldn’t you do it? It’s those little things that make people want to come back or recommend the place to friends. We don’t usually stay in five-star hotels (this was a special occasion), so maybe my expectations were too high, but I really didn’t think the hotel was exceptional enough to justify its exceptional room rates (hotels in Alto Adige are not generally very expensive). Very nice, yes, but not out of this world. The decor is elegant and tasteful, but it doesn’t have the charm of a historic hotel or the visual impact of a design hotel. The staff members are friendly and professional, but the lack of flexibility, especially considering that this was low season (the hotel was closing the following week), made the place feel kind of like an anonymous big resort hotel. Even though we enjoyed our stay and had no specific complaints, I think we’ll try somewhere else next time.",couple,NEG

Avoid the rooms at the front side ,just in front of the big parking area of the village , especially if you sleep with the window open, and you are sensible to rumours .What I really disliked is the restaurant policy to ask you to pay the tub water ,while the food is included in the price .I understand to pay the wine, but THE TUB WATER ? The food was not what you expect in the mountain : every evening we got shrimps ?! The afternoon snack was a dried,little piece of cake ,and generally, the food was not of the quality one expects .The only highlight of the dinner was the wine : we asked for glass of wine from the region that would match each dish , and we got to taste fabulous wines and to know something about this wine area , thanks to the waiter that took carefully care of us.

“What a lovely lady the owner is and a lovely hotel”,"We had been delayed descending from the Soyscharte Pass 2887m further up the valley on our circuit of the Ortler Group and got to the valley road at 19.30 hrs. We had nothing booked as we were not sure how we would get and on trying to phone one accommodation we had an out of date number. We decided to hitch and the first car stopped!! We gratefully jumped in and were asked where we wanted to go. I said Martello Dorf as it is main village in this lovely valley. The driver drove throught he village and on seeing this hotel he dropped us off. We were very tired and scruffy and probably smelly with our backpacks and we looked at each other and thought we could get turned away here even if there is room! Into the restaurant we went where everyone was tucking into the evening meal. Eventually an elegant lady approached us and we asked if she had a room for just the one night . She said yes and showed us to a lovely en suite room. A palace after being in Mountain Refuges. Then she said we could have half board if we could get washed up and changed in 20 minutes. So we got an evening meal as well. It was an excellent meal. We ordered 2 beers and a litre of water. The lady made us very welcome and told us the time of the bus the next morning and where to catch it. She also let us take breakfast at 7.30am whereas it is normally 8.00am. On paying the bill she said there was no charge for the water or beers, they were on her! That is what I call making your guests welcome. We were sad we were only there for the one night. The room was immaculate, the bed very comfortable, restaurant excellent, breakfast was varied and plentiful help yourself buffet. There is also a room downstairs where guests can sit and drink especially after the evening meal. We were so tired we went to bed! If you are in this area I would very strongly recommend this hotel. You will not be disappointed. This part of the Central Italian Alps is not frequented much by British Walkers/ climbers/tourists. I just do not know why.

“Short relaxing trip”,"Well, just wanted to take a couple days off away with my daughter and a friend and her daughter to do some shopping, wellness and play with the kids. It was quite okay when we got there, rooms were clean, a very well reception when you arrive. Dinner was okay menu was pre-planned not much room for individual choice. The pool was nice and clean indoor as well as outdoor. The rooms were very hot when the temperature raised over 29 degrees Celsius there was no a/c and for such that price I expected a little more. Nevertheless it was hard to sleep at night when it was so hot. You can have a car for free just have to put gas no rental charge. The sad thing is the children's menu was not fresh. I went with my girlfriend who is white and her daughter and they never spoke directly to me when she was there only questioning her about what she would like and this and that while I sat next to her the whole time. That sort of bothered me why are they not referring to me was it because I am black and they are not comfortable or that fact that I am American or they feared that I couldnt speak to them. I was not sure. nevertheless the girls at the front desk when I was alone was quite nice to me and made my stay welcomed along with the bartender.",family,NEG

“Hotel Mittelplatt - Half pension a great value for the money”,"We just spent 6 nights at the Hotel Mittelplatt, part of the four hotels that make up the Schenna Resort. This review is intended ONLY for the Hotel Mittelplatt as the other hotels were closed for the season during our stay. We visited in the last 7 days before they closed for a few weeks (much like all the hotels in the area between seasons). We therefore got a very low rate with half pension. Remodeled two years ago, this small hotel (26 rooms) is open, bright, warm and friendly. Our room, the """"pergola suite"""" was spacious and afforded a large terrace with a beautiful view. The open plan bathroom was modern and comfortable with a GREAT shower. The seating area comprised of a sofa, coffee table and desk allowed us to relax in the room, watch tv or read. The bed, slightly dissappointing, was both a little too hard for our taste and the pillows were not comfortable and for a couple, the two single duvets make sleeping with your partner a little less than wonderful as each single duvet barely covered one person, and certainly not two. The dining room offered a wonderful and extensive breakfast buffet with everything imaginable and also afforded a spectacular view. Dinner was a complete pleasure each night as the menu was diverse, perfectly prepared, tasty and the portions were appropriate. The spa was ideal for an afternoon relax. it was both large enough, warm enough and diverse enough for our taste...we thoroughly enjoyed it each day. Though the staff were helpful and friendly and made a point ot taking good care of us, we were dissappointed that no one from the large family who owns the Schenna Resort never made an appearance to greet or meet or welcome any of the guests, at least not that we ever saw. Daily visits at mealtime from a family member would """"warm"""" this typically sud-tirol environment and really help make it a first rate small hotel. All in all, None of the criticisms above got in the way of our enjoyment of our stay and would highly recommend it.",couple,POS
"“Good, but some service problems”","Dream location with hikes and great views. During our families two nights electricity shut the hotel down for an afternoon, two saunas did not work properly, towels were always running out and the wellness area ran out of drinks and cups early each day.

“Picturesque and friendly”,"Small family-run alpine guesthouse in magnificent countryside surrounding the breathtaking Dolomites. All the staff were friendly and outgoing, particularly the lady owner and nothing was to much trouble - ask, and it arrived. Although the cuisine would grace any top class restaurant I found the menu extremely limited especially since everything seem to centre on asparagus - the white variety is particularly disgusting. That said, the meat was cooked to perfection and the table service was what you might expect from a hotel carrying many more stars. The rooms were small and basic but had everything you need for a short stay (ours was a walking holding of only three days) The view from the balconies are superb but it might take a little time to work out the french windows - a curious set of levers on each side by the walls which lifted the doors to release the locks - try it before you drink the excellent, if pricey, wine otherwise you may find the puzzle somewhat difficult. Given the exceedingly low price for a resort gasthof in this setting, you'd be very hard pressed to find better value and comfort. Should you decide to sit outside to enjoy the view, be prepared to spend a little time throwing a yellow plastic toy for the owner's Alsatian (cross ?) which will demand your attention (whether you like it or not) - we did.

“Perfect Hostess”,"We couldn't have picked a better B&B for our stay in the Dolomites. We took Rick Steve's advice and chose Castelrotto as our base for our 3 night stay in the area. It's a quiet, small town but only 10-15 minutes from Alpe di Siusi. Most hotels and B&B's in the area are pricey, but not Haus Silbernagl. The B&B was only a 3 minute walk from the town center. There was plenty of free parking. Yet, what made Haus Silbernagle special is its owner, Petra. Every morning she'd offer us advice on the area attractions. Of course we wanted to hike the Alpine Meadow so Petra gave us a map and directed us to the perfect trail. Oh, what a hike it was too! We took a gondola and ski lift to get to the 4 mile loop. Two restaurants on the loop made for plenty of relaxation and the panoramic views were amazing. Petra couldn't have chosen better! The next day we wanted to visit the Archeology 'Otzi' Museum in Bolzano. Again, Petra gave us great directions to the museum. The B&B is surrounded by lovely gardens and mountain views. Our room was comfortable and clean. Breakfast was excellent too with plenty of coffee and eggs and bacon. During the day and evening, cold drinks, coffee or tea were available on the honor system. Can't say enough good things about this B&B. It should be in Rick Steve's Book!",family,POS

We were welcomed like family and treated even better. No request was too big, including watching the world cup game till 2am and mapping out a great route for a couple of our early birds Hotel Rainer may not be five star in actual rating, but it is more than 5 star in many ways. All the rooms have been recently renovated, clean, large and beautiful. The family and staff treat you like friends they have known for years. We were on ½ board and the food was varied and superb.

We took our mothers on a grand tour of Europe that included staying in a French Chateau, on Swiss lakes, Venice, 12th Century German hotels - they both thought this was the bests place, they had never imagined anywhere so beautiful or a welcome so personal.

“True to it's name!”,"We travelled here in mid-September 2012. The Hotel Bella Vista was something of a deus ex machina for us. We were driving through the alps on our way from Chur to Verona when we realised the sun was setting quickly and there was no way we could tackle the Stelvio pass in the dark. Stopping at a few hotels, we were turned down, and recommended to a hostel up the road. We didn't end up finding the hostel - but were so glad we found Bella Vista! Although our hosts were a bit startled at our late appearance, and weren't very good with English, they promptly found us a room at a surprisingly decent rate - inclusive of dinner and breakfast. I thanked them in my broken German and checked into our room, whilst my husband was helped with parking the car and bringing our luggage in. Now, when they said dinner was included, I wasn't expecting the four-course gourmet extravaganza that appeared before us. White linen tablecloths graced the formal dining room, glittering with candles and adorned with alpine flowers. We were served bread, soup, pasta, mains (some sort of steak/beef with vegetables), and dessert! You can have a look at my blog if you want photos, but even without photos, let me tell you that this food was phenomenal. We felt so bad that we are small eaters and couldn't finish all the food they presented us with, especially as they generously kept the kitchen open us for us. The woman from the front desk came to make conversation with us as we finished our wine - I noted her husband was talking to some other diners enjoying a late-night aperitif in the lounge bar. They seem very friendly, although all she could muster in English was """"I have been to Australia too - very pretty country"""". We admired her for trying! It was 11.00pm by the time we retired to bed with deliciously stuffed bellies; the last patrons at dinner. But the surprises didn't end there. The room bigger than we expected, with a separate sun room and balcony at the back. We slept very well that night, and awoke to the most breath-taking alpine views. The balcony, as we discovered in the morning light, overlooked the ski trails. It was of course summer, so we could see green pastures below, and the peaks of the mountains far above us. Simply stunning. Breakfast was served in the grand dining room again - a full buffet packed with cereals, fresh and dried fruits, nuts, breads, cheeses, meats, eggs and sausages, anything that you could think of really! We had fun peeking into all the dishes and baskets, taking a small sample of everything on offer and thoroughly enjoying our Swiss/German meal. After we ate, we stepped through the glass doors of the dining room into the grassy """"back yard"""" of the hotel that we saw from our balcony. Unable to believe we found such a gem of a hotel, we explored the grounds a bit as well as the interior of the hotel, taking it in properly, so as to never forget this special moment. In our explorations, we discovered the hosts we met the night before are the legendary Gustav Thoni - world champion skier - and his wife! My husband is an avid skier, so he was thrilled to speak to him again, and shake his hand before we checked out. A beautiful chalet, this hotel is a not-to-miss if traveling through the alps. Homely, comfortable, affordable, delicious food - we felt completely spoiled and hope to be back in ski season!

"“Perfect location on the Stelvio Pass, beautiful view, excellent food & wine”","We stayed here for one night on our touring holiday and cannot fault the accommodation or service. German is the first-choice language in this area of Italy, but we managed to communicate. Dinner was an exceptional 3-4 course set-menu, whilst breakfast was a buffet with many interesting choices. Photographs of a local Olympic champion skier Gustav Thoni adorn the walls, together with skiing memorabilia, and the hotel interior has the ambience of an upmarket ski-chalet. Our room was very comfortable and overlooked the mountains, a garden with children's play area, and a meadow at the back of the hotel. It was quiet enough (I didn't notice the church bells). I imagine the views are beautiful in Winter, when the Alps are snow-clad. Best of all, we were given a key enabling us to leave the hotel very early in the morning, so that we had already driven the Stelvio Pass both ways before breakfast!

Drinks consumed at dinner are paid for at check out and were reasonably priced. Breakfast was a buffet and provided a good start to the day. Overall the hotel was exceptional value, very clean and anything we required was well catered for by responsive staff. I only wish we had known about the hotel and could have stayed longer.

What a great little gem of a hotel in a magestic little valley high in the Italian Dolomites. The owner was warm and welcoming, speaks great English, German and Italian and made every effort to see that we had a great stay. The rooms are super clean and the beds and bedding are extremely comfortable. We missed breakfast on the last day so they insisted that we have capucino and kuchen before we left and even packed sandwiches for the next part of our vacation. Just up the road is Pragersee or Lago di Braies the pearl of the Dolomites! Just down the road is the famous Tre Cime di Lavaredo in the heart of the Dolomites!

“Picturesque and peaceful setting”,"Situated at the edge of a small village, in a green valley with gorgeous views,this hotel had a great charm. The rooms were spacious, very clean and comfortable, bathrooms were state of the art. Most rooms have balconies ,which were overflowing with flowers when we visited in the third week of September.We could hear the church bells and cow-bells from the valley. The hotel is on the road to Lago de Braies (walking distance if you are fit) , but the road is very quiet at night.The food was plentiful (supper is a five-course affair; in the morning, one chooses one of two options for that evening's meal.) and great packed lunches were provided for a reasonable fee for our hiking trips.The owners were very nice and accomodating.The Alto Adige area has a great system of public transport -there is even a bus going to Tres Cines. The area is a bit remote from larger towns; this was not a drawback to us but might be for disco-goers.

“One of the Greatest Alpine Hotels”,"I have visited the Alps every year for 30+ years and the family run Hotel Cristallo is by far the best!

“An absolute gem!”,"I just returned to the US after spending a week in early July at the Hotel Cristallo. The hotel is wonderfully situated with views of the Ortler and surrounding peaks from many of the bedrooms. The rooms are clean, comfortable and decorated in typical South Tyrolean style. The hotel makes a great base from which to explore the hiking trails in the nearby mountains. Hotel staff lead guided hikes and cycling tours and can also advise guests who may wish to explore independently. The dining room and cuisine are absolutely outstanding...the warm croissants filled with apricot jam at breakfast are to die for. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough!

“A gem in a beautiful mountain valley”,My wife and I recently stayed 1 night during a driving tour of the Dolomites. The hotel is situated in a beautiful remote valley with mountains all around and a short walk to 3 lifts to access the many hiking paths. The family running this hotel were always polite and helpful. We booked the room with half board package and the food and wine was exceptional and therefore a great value. The whole place was very clean. We wished that we could have stayed longer.

And the parents just had some time to relax and enjoy the excellent food, wine and the just the whole environment around the Hotel. Just excellent, we will come again!",family,POS
“Absolute Perfection”,"In several decades we have never stayed at a place that combined such magnificent surroundings, comfortable rooms, superb food and outstanding service! To sit in the indoor-outdoor pool looking out at the surrounding Dolomite Mountains is alone worth the stay. The imaginative international food service was worth signing up for """"Halbpension"""". My wife had the best massages (including foot) there. The service includes suggestions for hikes and sightseeing from there , guided and unguided. There are many easy walks in beautiful scenery, woods, fields, mountain views, directly out of the hotel without driving. The Hotel is at the terminal for the cable car to Bolzano as well as at the stop of the narrow gage railroad that runs to neighboring villages on this scenic, high plateau, so one can get away without driving. There is a free card from the hotel (and from others as well) for free rides on the cable car, railroad, museums and the train from Bolzano to Merano. The only down side is finding the hotel if you are driving. Besides the daunting, winding road from the Autostrada to Soprabolzano, there are very few helpful road signs and a complete lack of signs to the Hotel. We were literally guided there by a kind local with his car. The Holzner family literature writes that they strive for perfection in their hotel and we must say they have achieved it.

“Perfection in a perfect setting.”,"Oh God, this hotel is absolutely marvellous. The review below that said the rooms are somehow old-fashioned made me laugh, because one of the fabulous things about the hotel is that the original Art-Deco style in the reception rooms is immaculately preserved and beautifully maintained! Even the light fittings are original, and incredibly lovely. Where do I start with my praise? The staff are fantastic and you become quietly aware over your stay of the deep pride they have in this establishment. And some of them have been there for decades. I must also mention our fellow guests who were without exception the most courteous fellow guests I've ever come across. Not annoyingly over-friendly, just courteous. As soon as they recognise you, they nod quietly. It's hard to describe. And although the place is stuffed to the gunwales with young families, not once were we irked by a wailing child or a spoiled toddler. Many of the groups holidaying together were not only three-generational, they had been going there for years and years. Position couldn't be more convenient. It's beside the cable car that brings you up from Bolzano, and also the narrow-gauge railway that will trundle you to Klobenstein. You can hear neither of these from a few yards away, incidentally. There's a ton to do at the hotel - they've thought of everything. Little pedal cars for toddlers, wooden steps up to the reception desk and a colouring sheet for children bored while their parents talk to the reception staff. Tennis courts. A marvellous, ultra-modern indoor and outdoor pool connected by a narrow channel. A lovely garden that supplies the hotel flowers. And every morning they produce a leaflet (""""journal"""") suggesting things to do, activities that the hotel is arranging, and giving interesting bits of local history. Breakfast is simply the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. A wonderful array of food displayed in portions that are constantly replenished and never get a bit dry and curled up. Bread you can slice yourself. Eggs and pancakes freshly cooked as you like them on a griddle and served with a flourish and a smile. Oranges you can squeeze yourself (in a proper orange squeezer, I should add), and a veg juicer. And the most delicious cakes and pastries that disappear too quickly. Just fabulous. If I have a tip for British travellers, it is that the food in the restaurant was very salty to our taste. We learned on night 3 to say, """"not too salty"""" when we made our order, and enjoyed the food much better as a result. Also, it is a surprise that there's such a small choice of food on offer in the dining room. Three starters, three mains and two puddings or cheeseboard. My partner was disappointed by this, he'd have liked more choice, but to my mind it means that everything is wonderfully fresh. And South Tyrolean food is slightly heavy compared with modern British food - lots of dumplings! - and as I adore dumplings, this was a dream for me. But my partner is not a dumpling fancier, so I add this just in case it affects your choice. I think if we go back (and I certainly hope we do) I might be more adventurous and not do half-board, so that we have a choice. There are other places to eat in the area, and I have no doubt the hotel would arrange transport because there seemed to be nothing they wouldn't do for you. All in all, this is a remarkable hotel - 4 generations in the same family - in a ravishing part of the world. The beauty is heartstopping - I cannot reccommend it too heartily.",couple,POS
“one of a kind”,"This part of the world is like a fairy tale and the best way to enjoy it is Holzner. The staff was omnipresent and ready to help in any way. The food was excellent. And I was happy to show off my pink tennis shoes when I got home (red clay courts). We had 2 new, very modern rooms a bit away from the main building so it was as quiet and as functional as could be. Kids are well cared for it looks so it makes for some pretty happy adults in a very friendly atmosphere. We're going back as soon as we can.

“Feels Like Home”,"I've been going to this hotel since I was 6 years old (21 now), and it really is a home away from home.

“Not a hotel where I would go back to”,"The hotel is well located, personnel is kind, but I believe there is a lot of work to be done there. The atmosphere wasn't ideal to me, I never felt home and the old style is not appealing to me I guess. Food needs a lot of improvement, they use lots of cream and tomato sauce, which is not my favorite. We thought we'd find a vegetarian menu as red on their web site, but there was really nothing vegetarian, they just adjusted to us cooking funky veg food such as cotolette di verdure.... The SPA is not bad, it has 3 saunas and steam bath, a lovely pool and it's cozy, but again, not my style. I don't think the price is fair for what you find.",couple,NEG

“wunderbar / wonderful”,"Feldmilla is one of the best hotels in which I've ever had the pleasure to stay. Sometimes hotel websites mislead you, making the place seem much nicer than it really is. Not in this case. In person Feldmilla is just as beautiful if not more so. Even by the very high standards of hotel hospitality in the Alto Adige / Sudtirol (which, IMO, are among the best in the world) Feldmilla is a standout. And the price / quality ratio to me seems simply unbeatable. The place is close to perfection. The rooms are very large, super clean and very comfortable. They have excellent bathrooms with high quality fixtures. The architect did a great job of providing visuals from the guest rooms and public areas to the gorgeous mountains around Campo Tures (which is one of the prettiest towns in the whole region). If you like the relaxing sound of running water you can open your balcony window to hear the scenic, small river that runs through Campo Tures, just a few meters away. The food is absolutely excellent. For the past 10 winters or so I’ve been coming to the Trentino / Alto Adige area to ski and have stayed in many very good hotels in Canazei, Moena, Ponte di Legno, and other places in Northern Italy. The food at Feldmilla is in another league. It has more variety and sophistication and is presented with great art and style, as in a “nouveau cuisine” restaurant. The details are very well done— for instance it has one of the best salad and breakfast bars I’ve ever seen. Very fresh and flavorful ingredients. The chef is very talented and generally prepared the dishes (fish, vegetarian, meat, pastas, risottos, soups, whathaveyou) with subtlety. The Spa area is hands down the best of any place I’ve been to below the 5 star level. If you compare it to similarly priced hotels in Italy (and, no doubt Europe in general) there is no competition. It is much larger, better equipped, and more beautiful. Again here, small details are not overlooked. There is a small self-service “bar” in the sauna/pool area that offers mint tea, mineral water and fresh fruit. Also the steam bath has a bucket with homemade rosemary salt that you rub on your skin to assist the skin cleansing process. After a few days my skin felt almost as smooth as a baby’s. One feature that you often don’t find in similar places is the spa’s large “pine” lounge, with many pine wood planks emitting a lovely fragrance in a reduced lighting, cool lounge that can’t help but relax you. Finally, the hotel and dining room staff are very professional, pleasant and helpful— without being at all intrusive. Feldmilla is a family owned and run operation and that makes a noticeable positive difference in the level of service compared to a manger run, corporate-owned place. The owners are very pleasant and, just like their staff, were available to assist or help when we needed it.",friends,POS

“Very pleasantly surprised.”,"Stayed May 2014. Looking for a place to stay close to the Dolomites and Bressanone, we found Hotel Hochrain after looking at a couple of hotels nearby. It immediately appealed. The courteous and friendly Fundneider family showed the 4 of us rooms which we immediately loved. Great views from good sized balconies. Very clean and nicely furnished. A problem with the free internet in our room was quickly solved with a smile. Christian, you are a credit to your industry. We couldn't have asked for more during our 2 night stay.

It's like coming home, we have our usual beautiful spacious room looking across the meadow at the village and the mountains and all the apple orchards. There is a free health spa and large brick pizza oven and several different dining room to eat inside or out. Across the road from the hotel begin several hiking trails and we love the one around the lake. About a 20 minute hike below the hotel will take you to the Neustif Monastery where they make their own wines and is a lovely place for lunch or dinner. There is bus service down into the town of Bressanone or you can drive. It is a beautiful old city of about 20,000 people with elegant shops and nice restaurants. The Hochrain is also perfectly located for taking day trips into the Dolomites, such interesting and scenic drives whether winter or summer and the big ski center of Plose is nearbye and worth a visit no matter what time of year..The food, the accommodations, the service, the value and cost and the location all help to make the Hochrain a very special place.

“Lots of room”,"My family and I stayed here for two nights the weekend prior to Christmas to enjoy the market in nearby Bressanone. We stayed in an apartment and loved all the room.

The beds were very comfortable and the apartment was very clean. We enjoyed the restaurant very much and ate there both nights of our stay. Our particular waitress took care of both nights and treated my children with much love and attention (something very important to me). We did not get to use the spa or pool facilities do to the limited time we had to spend. If you are planning on visiting the Christmas market in Bressanone, it is about a 20-25 minute walk to the center along a gorgeous bicycle path.

“Modern but a little noisy”,"Large modern hotel near Dobbiaco railway station, with some spa facilities. Comfortable if slightly functional rooms. Good breakfast. The hotel has busy roads on both sides so is a little noisy if you leave windows open.",friends,NEG
“back after two years”,"I went back after two years. Still the same. We enjoy the location because it's near the centre of Dobbiaco. Just an advice, this time we had a room street side. It is bit noisy cause it's the principal street (Dolomitenstrasse) and there is a bit of traffic. My advice is to ask for a room/apartment at the other side (garden side). Also, better pay a little more for a renewed appartment. Other reviews say the owner is not nice, that's not true, he is cold, which is differente from beign rude. In any case he'll help you if you need advice or everything. Room Tip: renewed apartment and garden side room/apartment See more room tips",couple,NEG
“Walking off the kilos!”,Our last week of a 5 week holiday - and walking in the Dolomites was fantastic - and to wake up each day and come back each afternoon to welcoming staff was wonderful. Also excellent massage staff and spa facilities - spa could have been a bit warmer tho. And apart from one young waiter who made it clear to us on the last couple of days - we had done something wrong (still don't know what it was!!) - all the other staff were absolutely outstanding thank you Family Fuchs...,None,POS
“Excellent staff”,"The hotel was clean and comfortable as one would expect, but my lasting impression is of the kindness and efficiency of the staff. They advised on food and wine, arranged trips, answered questions patiently and were friendly and funny. We asked about rosti, not realising we weren't in quite the right region, but at dinner the next night there were two portions that had been specially made for us. The food was good quality. We had superb venison and lamb and excellent pasta dishes. Pike-perch, bream and salmon were also fresh and well-cooked. Local wines were around 20-24 euros a bottle and good value. Wifi was available only in reception and the little seated area off it. It would have been great to have had it throughout the hotel, particularly in the bedrooms. We were wary of railway noise and asked for a room on the other side. Room 216 had a balcony with a table and chairs, a double bed and a table with two padded benches next to the TV. A large wardrobe had plenty of hangers and there was also a second large cupboard with shelves. We had a lot of bulky luggage and backpacks; there was room for it all. NB There was no fridge in the room.",couple,POS
“A master class in customer service”,"This family run hotel is a master class in customer service, nothing is too much trouble and the staff are excellent. We arrived late due to flight problems (we ended up having to take a train from Munich) but we were not rushed in spite of arriving at the end of dinner service. We were also collected from the station - even though it was a 2 minute walk. We were halfboard and the food was very good in terms of both quality and quantity although you really do need to be skiing, snowshoeing or walking strenuously if you want to work your way through all the courses at dinner, and take full advantage of the extensive breakfast buffet. The hotel has a pleasant spa and we enjoyed some excellent sports massages. Although the Sud Tyrol is technically in Italy, the hotel and the village tend towards their Austrian heritage particularly the food (lots of meat, hearty desserts). We upgraded to a junior suite which was well worth the money with a lovely view south towards the mountains. The only slight negative is that the railway runs alongside the hotel and there is some noise if the window is open. Room Tip: Treat yourselves to a junior suite See more room tips",couple,POS
“Hospitality at it's best”,"We stayed here during a self-arranged walking holiday over the summer. What a fantastic all round experience - staff, room, food, location - everything. Our holiday was delayed due to illness but the Fuchs family did everything to accommodate us. The breakfast buffet, packed lunch for the hikes and the evening meal were all fantastic. And what a location....only writing this review now as I am hankering to go back! What a lovely valley and mountains for cycling and hiking. Can't wait to go back.",couple,POS

I stayed here for a week as part of the Exodos hiking trip of the Dolomites Mountains. The staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful. The service was excellent. Accommodation comfortable and well maintained. Dining room...the food was of high quality and plentiful. Again, the staff were attentive. The swimming pool, spa and sauna area was well used at the end of the day after a days hiking. Loved the 'jets' and the 'peppermint shower'! Nothing was ever any trouble for the staff.

Complimentary spa and pool. It is only a couple of blocks away from the bus station.",couple,POS
“Excellent service at this friendly hotel”,"We stayed here for a week as part of a group on a snowshoe walking holiday. Other reviewers have already identified the plus points: substantial breakfasts; excellent 5 course evening meals (with the cover charge for a carafe of water at 1Euro 50 not too outrageous); relaxing spa and ideal location in the quiet village. Many of our group felt that the choice of dark green paint in the bedrooms, made the rooms feel dowdy and small. The woodwork needed some attention too. That said, the rooms were cosy -the heat from the minibar was a great place to dry clothes- and clean. The waiting-on staff were all very friendly, hard working and knowledgeable; making appropriate suggestions for choices of wine. They were good humoured when dealing with our large group, particularly when we couldn't make up our minds over the extensive food choices! Vegetarians and those with specific dietary requirements were well catered for. Villabassa is a small, but it's less than a 5 minute walk to the station, where you can catch regular (and cheap) trains to other towns in the area. The bus stop is a 1 minute walk from the hotel. Reception staff were only to happy to offer suggestions of places to visit, or to give times of trains and buses. We spoke with people who were staying in the apartments and they seemed very happy with the service and the fact that they had the use of the spa/sauna and pool. It would be interesting to return and see the area in summer. I think all of us in the group felt that Hotel Adler was an excellent base for our holiday.",couple,POS
“Magnifico Dobbiacio”,"My wife and I stayed here for one week from June14th and have to say experienced one of the most fantastic, breathtaking and friendliest holidays we have ever had. We enjoy the outdoors especially hiking and this place has it all 5star. We travelling by train from Munich through the Alps, what a start. The Union Hotel is literally 100 yards from the station so no transfer problems just a one minute walk. From our arrival until departure we were treated as one of the family and it just got better as the week went on. The room was maybe a little on the small size but this faded into insignificance when we opened the balcony doors to our view of the Dolomites. This is a family owned and run hotel with a very ample breakfast and dinner each night freshly made and a real taste of Italian cuisine, all very nice. Our week was full of walks and bus trips to different start points for walking and viewing the Dolomites. These are spectacular and a joy to experience. Our Hotel owner was so helpful in explaining where and when to get the correct buses. We bought a Mobilcard for 28 euro each which gave us unlimited train and bus use in the area for 7 days. The hotel had a necessary timetables and walking/hiking maps. It was so easy to get anywhere and some of the bus journeys would take your breath away with views and the very bendy roads. I have to say that this is somewhere we have to go back to as we left it with such happy memories and still have much to do and see. To the owners and staff of the Union Hotel we thank you for your help and kindness and wish you all a long and properous future.",couple,POS

"“Will not stay there, ever!”","We stayed at this place for a week. It's part of our walking holiday package. This hotel benefits from a great location. Rooms could do with a makeover, but at least they are clean. Bathroom amenities are not replenished though - so make sure you bring enough. We were given one sachet of bath gel/shampoo and 2 pieces of tiny soap for two people for 7 days! The worst thing is the food. Whoever who made the food simply doesn't like food. And the hotel obviously don't know about vegetarian. We finally cracked and decided to have our last night dinner at a nearby restaurant. That proved to be the best thing we did for the whole week.",friends,NEG
“Not A Good Choice”,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 7 nights as part of group holiday tour. I definitely would have changed hotels after the first night if on my own. The man and woman that run the hotel were unfriendly, unhelpful and plain rude. We were on a half board basis. The food was average with small portions. There were flies everywhere in the dinning area. Service was extremely slow especially when coach trips were also there. Dinner one night took 1 ½ hrs. There was no tea or coffee at dinner and tap water was 1 euro. The hotel advertises free wi fi but my computer was one of the ones that had some sort of problem and never got connected. When I asked for assistance Daniela, the Manager, said she knew nothing about it, and it was my problem and turned her back and walked away. Mid way through the week we asked for more soap and the man said “you get soap at arrival and after that you have to use your own.” Our room received minimal housekeeping service and rarely fresh towels. The window was always opened and left despite the weather and flies were always a problem. Everything at the hotel seemed to be designed to get as much money as possible from the guests without providing any quality service in return. I doubt the hotel will ever improve as they seem to cater to tour group operators and ignore individual guests. Dobbiaco is a nice small town and in a good location for touring the Dolomites. It has an excellent bus and train station. However, I would definitely recommend staying at one of the other many hotels in town.",couple,NEG
"“Great Staff, Awesome Food”","The structure is old and tired but full of charm. Staff are friendly and helpful. Food is fantastic.

“Fabulous week's stay for Pusteria choir festival”,"Wonderful, wonderful stay!! OK, one or two minor annoyances, but easily overcome. Service: friendly, helpful, attentive throughout, and all too happy to meet our special health related requests Room: Great! Superb view of the mountains over the Nordic skiing centre. Nice balcony, good bathroom although a bath, rather than a shower, would have been even better. The hotel is very close indeed to a busy road with some heavy lorries - and motorbikes galore. We asked in advance for a rear room, having seen the photos, but you could still hear the traffic, AND were woken several weekday mornings at 6.40am by chainsaws. But hey, we could have gone somewhere else without these problems and had far worse in every other respect, and ear plugs sorted it! We slept very well indeed! Dinner: very enjoyable. Being on a special deal it was a fixed four course menu. It helps if you like meat! But they were happy to provide a fish alternative, and the first salad course could be a main meal replacement if none of the other dishes suited! And every dish we had was enjoyed. Drinks were reasonably priced for a hotel of this type in an area like this and there were plenty of sitting areas indoors and out for relaxation with a good ambience. The Wellness Spa was also good and reasonably priced for the area. Plenty of sunbathing grass and with small indoor and outdoor pools. The hotel layout is quirky with lots of twists and turns, but accessibility didn't seem to be a problem. Good garage too for parking, although a little pricey. Breakfast was very good although we never got to the bottom of whether boiled eggs were charged extra or not. We were told they were, 5 Euros an egg, which is ridiculous if true, but then the two we'd had before we learnt that weren't charged for! Good choice of fruit, breads, breakfast meats, salads, jams and drinks, with a waffle station too. Cleanliness: Perfect. Location: excellent (unless you don't like the proximity to the road). Absolutely great walk up to and around Dobbiaco Lake. Not too far from the centre of the village either. San Candido and other resorts and Dolomite highlights are all reasonably close by. All in all, highly recommended. Room Tip: Ask in advance for a room at the back or take ear plugs See more room tips",friends,POS

Everyone was nice and helpful. We were especially impressed with the waiters.",couple,POS
“We came for the location - wowed by the food!!”,"We were looking for a hotel with easy access to the Dolomiti and thanks to other reviews we selected the Santer Hotel. We were very happy with the Hotel from the moment we arrived. It is traditional in style - lots of wood and traditional in service. Really felt like a family business. As it was low season (may) and unseasonably cold, it wasn't very busy and we were given an upgraded suite. The room was large, the bed comfy and a nice size balconly overlooked the Dolomiti and the outdoor heated spa pool. In addition to a full set of bath towels, our spa needs were also looked after - including a separate towel for the spa, a bathrobe and slippers - to get all this down to the spa area, 2 large tote bags were also in the room. I did want to take one back with me but chickened out in the end. We weren't sure of our plans so we didn't book the full board option but were told at reception that we were welcome to eat in the ala carte restaurant which had late opening times. Due to a change in plans, we were back earlier than expected so we did eat in the restaurant and it was one of the BEST meals we have ever eaten!! The produce was local, fresh and beautifully cooked and presented. So good that we had to go back the next night as well! We had deer, lamb, chicken, veal, pork, tagliatelle, ravioli, wild mushrooms, chicory, forest berries and would have more if we weren't so stuffed!! The service was friendly and even though I tried to use Italian - they were very happy to translate and even tell us the history of the dishes we selected - including some local ways of serving. Another added bonus was the wellness area. The outdoor pool turned out to be a pool sized hot tub. It was a treat to be able to lounge about in hot bubbly water while looking out over snow covered mountains. Within the 'chalet style' relaxation area were a little sauna (more in the 'nude' zone but we didn't venture there) and 'hay' bed, a salt inhalation room, a juice bar and lots of beds and loungers. There were 2 different fire places but none were in use in May - it must be a spectacular place to chill out in winter. We will make every effort to come back to the Hotel Santer - for the sevice, the comfy rooms, the wellness area and most definitely THE FOOD!!",couple,POS
“not what it promisses to be”,"The hotel is a bit dissapointing and not really worth the 4 stars because of a combination of things.... It is on a very bussy road with traffic night and day. Backside is quiet et with a splendid view. The whole hotel is full of little stairs and differences in level, quite a challenge, specially as it is too dark everywhere... in the restaurant, in the hall, in the rooms, in the wellness... The rooms are dark but extremely clean. Beds are very good but hardly 30 cm high. Welness is large and well equiped but only opens at 4pm even on rainy days. You get one single towel that can be changed by room-service the next morning, you'd better not get too wett... Food at dinner is excellent and presented in a nice way. Service in the restaurant however is below the level of a 4-star house. Things are forgotten or orders messed up. The two gentlemen in the restaurant pay most attention to the Italian public (specially when in skirts...) The (temp) girls in the bar and restaurant (Kathrin and Daniella) did a great job and were very kind. Over all... not what we expected from this hotel.

The hotel is also not far away from the Dolomites and was like our gateway to other outdoor activities. Apart from that, this locally-owned business was really run to perfection - from the lovely breakfasts to the comfortable rooms and friendly, professional service. On our off days, it was great to just sit on the terrace to have a long delicious lunch with a glass of wine. The rooms have a modern, yet homely feel to them and were very clean and spacious. The main city area is easily accessible by foot, or if you have a lot of luggage, the hotel is also located right near a bus stop.",couple,POS

Electronic shutters on the windows were a novelty but kept the cold out a treat. The bathroom was spacious with a heated towel rail but the hairdryer was ineffective like blow drying your hair with a hand dryer. This was the only negative about this hotel.

Loved the big down duvets too! The meals were exquisite! Dinner meals included salad, soup, a warm appetizer, a superbly prepared entree and the dessert, which was always sinfully rich. Nice wine selection too. The hotel itself is charming throughout, with nice touches, and a long history of hospitality for over 75 years by the lovely Ortner family. Very nice wellness center on-site, cross-country ski trails at the front door, and a nice path to the village of San Candido about a half mile away. Not to miss is a drive to the ski area of Mt.

“Very helpful and friendly Walch Family”,"We stayed at Hotel Cristallo for 2 nights after a week hiking in the Dolomites. We are Canadians hikers and it was our fist big trek in Italy and the Sudtyrol mountains. I e-mailed the hotel a month before our arrival asking if we good store our excess luggage with them while we went on our hike. Within a few ours I received a reply from the owners, one of the Walch brothers, telling us they would gladly accommodate our request. Arriving in Dobbiaco just hours before our week long hike, with our extra luggage in tow, we had a million questions about the bus, our way back after the hike, taxis etc... With grace and patience, Mr Walch answered all of our questions and found a solution for all of them. They went well over and above anyones expectations. Once of weeklong hike completed, we returned to the hotel and the stored luggage. We also found a spacious room with a large modern bathroom. We slept so well. Located just a few minutes from the train station of Dobbiaco, we found restaurants, gelato..bank, cultural visits. The hotel has an indoor pool, restaurant and a spa.

There is also a pool, sauna, and lawn. Breakfast was included, but underwhelming. Two concerns: First, I thought the place was a little overpriced given we were mid-week early in the season. Second, take a look at the place on an internet map. You're definitely not in the middle of nowhere as a major road runs close to the hotel. Means you can access many areas with your cars or the SAD buses, and get to enjoy a variety of bars and restaurants, but it definitely isn't the wilderness. Would still stay here again, though.

Our rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable and the common areas of the hotel were lovely. We booked at the hotel on a “half-board” option and ate each night in the restaurant in the hotel and the food was delicious, with a choice from three menus each night and a good mix of local specialities and some more “approachable” options for the less adventurous. On two of the nights we were staying the hotel organised special events in the hotel lobby - prosecco and aperitivi on one night and mulled wine and Christmas sweets on another - which was a lovely addition to the stay.

The food was excellent- simple home style cooking but with high quality fresh ingredients - and generous offers of second helpings! The owners (who speak English, Italian and German) are warm and friendly and really made us feel comfortable and at home. We would definitely stay there again.

They're willing to offer something out of the menu when our children didn't like anything on the menu that day. Good food - their breakfast buffet is extensive: bread, cold cuts, many kinda of teas and jams, fruits, cereal, muesli, etc. The quality of food is excellent!! I can go on and on.....

San Cadido is a charming little town nestled in a beatiful valley between some very impressive mountains. The people of the town were warm and friendly and the town was spotless. The half board dining at the hotel was divine. Five course gourmet meals cooked to perfection served by the best waiter I have ever had. The breakfast was equally as good. The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and attentive to any request we made. Fluffy comforters on comfortable beds. Heated floors and towel racks in the bathroom.

We were travelling with our two teenage children and all stayed in one of their two bedroom rooms. The rooms are well designed and the timber work beautiful. We did half board so all of us sat together for a cold and cooked breakfast, then hiked or cycled during the day, back for afternoon cake and then a four or five course dinner at night. The food was different every night and on Wednesday nights the band played traditional music for the guests. The half board was great value and the area is absolutely beautiful. I would like to thank all the staff, they made our time there very special and we would recommend it to anyone thinking of staying in the Dolomites.",family,POS

Our room was traditional in style for the Dolomites with a balcony and a large bathroom and separate wc with hand basin. I would recommend that guests opt for half board as this is excellent value and wine is also available at reasonable prices. The scenery around the hotel is beautiful with clearly marked walks available and various beauty spots within easy driving distance, The owners were always available to answer any questions and assist in any way possible. The hotel is well staffed and everyone we met was very pleasant and professional. They obviously have an excellent chef as we were amazed at the quality and quantity of the food provided at dinner.

“Made Our Stay an Absolute Pleasure”,"We stayed at Hotel Monica for three days in May 2013 and took the half-pension option. The standard of food, service and quality of room far exceeded our expectations. This is a medium-sized family run hotel but they make you feel very much at home: Roman is the main man with wife Monica along side (obviously). The evening meals are outstanding (5 course dinners of typical South Tyrolean dishes and local wines at very reasonable prices). The breakfasts are substantial and cater for many divergent tastes - cereal, fruit salad, cooked eggs as you like, meats, cheeses, toast and marmalade. Nothing was too much trouble for mien hosts to assist us (we were on a cycling holiday and encountered bad weather during our stay). The other staff were all very helpful and friendly.

During our stay, there was live entertainment on Wednesday night (Roman's band - very good)! We had a junior suite - it included a small second bedroom and a large bathroom with a big tub and shower. The room was very nice - spacious, great cupboard and closet space, and a small balcony, which in the winter is a great place to keep beverages cold! The room was clean and well maintained (as was the entire property). We had breakfasts and dinners included in our package and both meals were excellent. I definitely recomment the half-board option. Staff were excellent, as were the hosts, Roman and Monica. There is a ski room with lockers for storage of skiis and boots and includes an area for waxing. Parking is included. Things to be aware of - wifi only in the lobby and not until after 7:00 a.m. and at times it was very slow. The in-room amenities are limited - be sure to bring body lotion and shampoo and conditioner (soap and a generic shampoo are provided). There is no in-room refrigerator nor a kettle or any amenities for tea or coffee. There is no fitness centre but in all likelihood, if you are staying here, you will be on an active holiday - cross country or down hill skiing or hiking and won't really be worried about getting your ususal workout in!

The hotel was excellent. Varied, wholesome and very tasty evening meals with good choices. Wine prices perfect. Breakfast good choices, although I did miss a fruit salad. The croissants were excellent! Our room was spacious and well appointed. I would have liked the odd picture on the walls. The hotel lounges, bars and sun terrace were excellent, all very cosy,comfortable and attractive The staff were very helpful and courteous. We had very little Italian and they, except the managers, very little English, but all displayed warmth and smiles. The bonus was the price, oh for hotels of this quality and value in England.

The room was not air conditioned but that presented no problem as the hot day time temperatures became pleasntly cool during the evening. The food served in the restaurant was good wholesome local fare with great variety and choices of both starter and main courses.Breakfast was buffet style but again ws of good quality. All members of the staff were a delight to deal with despite most having little or no English ( and we certainly had no Italian). The real surprise was the price;€57 ( rising later in the week to €65) per person per night for half board represented outstanding value. Dobbiaco is also an excellent centre from which to visit the most attractive parts od the Dolomites.",friends,POS

Our room was clean and satisfactory from a size and furnishings point of view (bed was good), although the shower screen required attention as it almost fell off its tracks when moved. Breakfast was relatively basic (limited selection), with the buns being stale and dishes not being re-filled when almost empty. Service at breakfast was also of a sub standard quality. Upon checking out the following morning, again no one was at reception and then to compound matters, when we did eventually receive service, the printer would not work to produce an invoice. It is interesting to note that the last review was in 2007 which was quite favourable (along with earlier reviews) and one wonders whether there may have been a change of management, as our experience certainly did not mirror the earlier reviews, with service being vitually non existant.",couple,NEG

“What a tiny room”,"The name of the hotel I stayed is Hotel Mühlgarten. The address is the same as this one. It shows as a 4-star hotel. We had a double room. When we opened the room door, we were surprised that the room is so small. The aisle at both sides of the bed is about one foot each only. We found out later the most incredible thing is that the door to the veranda can not be fully opened because of the bed. Every time we want to go to the veranda we had to pass the corner of the bed first and open the door ajar to go through with our body at some angles. At night since the door can not be opened, it was very hot inside the room. We asked the clerk I thought was a manager to change a room, she said it is not possible. I told her I can not imagine a four star hotel would provide such a tiny room. She said it is nothing to do with 4 stars. I really do not understand why should I have to pay the money for 4-star hotel and get such a tiny room even smaller than the non-star hotel rooms in downtown London.",couple,NEG

Nice spa area but also there poor service : only after we requested it water/tea was awailable. Bathrobe only at a charge of 4 euros. The kitchen is good, the buffet of salad is average and missing the care of a 4 star hotel. Not nice is also the A4 papers fixed on the buffet with tape informing in a unfriendly tone that its not allowed to take away food from the breakfast buffet, not very elegant. Very quiet at night.

“Hotel Condor white week experience”,"In the hotel Condor you will meet the friendly and professional staff. There are room facilities, comfort, parking and high standard of foot. It can be said value for money. We have spent for a few times white week in Condor. It is a great place for skiing. Hotel is in the walking distance to skiing lift Miara. The hotel accommodation also includes a ski-box in Miara Ski Salon and possibility of leaving your ski equipment. For recommendation.",family,POS
“We got a bad deal.”,"We have 3 kids and we got room 204 in Condor hotel. The setup for families with 3 kids does not work. There was no option for larger room and they did not have connecting rooms. In this room (204) you had an option to put two kids in one improvised room and have 1 kid with parents in the other room. The problem with this setup is that kids typically do not like to be split up and if they are split up then parents have no time to relax on their own. Therefore, my wife and I ended up sleeping on small beds (couch) for kids for 10 days. This was 360 Euros per day hence you can see why I'm a bit disappointed. Other downsides: -The number of electric plugs was terrible. We had to move furniture around to charge phones/tablets/computers. -All bathrobes for kids are the same size. Hence, the 4 year old would get his stuff wet at the pool. That is OK, but it is not OK that the room did not have a heated radiator so that our pool equipment can dry itself during the day. -There are no slippers provided. Hence, you need to bring your slipped for swimming pool. This is OK, if one knows the info ahead of time. However, I expected that 1Euro hotel slippers would be provided in 4 star hotel. -The number of places where you can hang stuff in the room was also poor. Basically, you had to walk through the entire place to get to hangers for jackets. -Food in the restaurant is good. However, whatever time you show up for dinner you are ending at around 9.10 PM. We are just not used to eating that late and this was a bit of a problem for us. -This hotel is close to the slope, but it is not ski in/out. In the morning you have to take 200m hike, which is problematic because you are essentially going up the street inhaling car fumes. -There is an issue with families of >2 and ski lockers that are located at the slope. As said we had 5 skiers (2 adults, 3 kids) and with only 1 locker we had to improvise to leave skis on the slope over night. -Ski room in the hotel has only 1 chair and it does not have heated boot warmers. Again because of the ski locker situation I walked in my ski boots to/from hotel. However, if anyone else was in the ski room you had to either wait or improvise. Also by the end of skiing my boots were wet on the inside. -The internet service works well on phones. However, several folks in our group had problems using corp computers to access internet. These are all small details, but these things add up... Compared to other 4 star hotels, Condor is at the end of the spectrum. Now some positives: -Other folks in our group (including my parents) got regular rooms. Regular rooms (those for 2-4 folks) are OK size and reasonably well organized. -Service in the hotel is good. Folks are friendly and genuinely interested in helping out. For example, I had a hard time using internet on my corp computer and the owner of the place did everything in his power to help me out. -The quality of food is pretty good. -Swimming pool is pretty warm and pretty large. Room Tip: Do not take room 204. Beware if you have 3 kids, I'm not sure in which room you will fit. See more room tips",family,NEG
“Great hotel for families with children”,"We have stayed at Hotel Condor for the Christmas week and were very satisfied. The hotel is conveniently situated near Miara ski lift - maybe 200m, easy to walk. Hotel gives you a card for the locker at the lift, so you can leave skis/boots there and walk to the hotel like normal people do. This worked great for us since we have 8 year old and 1 year old - we could easily go between hotel and lift several times a day. It is also close to the village center. Hotel has all required facilities - ski storage room, restaurant, game room, swimming pool, sauna, beauty salon and even a shooting range! Food included in Halfboard package is excellent! They make hot food (omelettes) for breakfast which you don't typically get in other similar hotels. Christmas dinner was perfect - together with Santa and chocolate fondue! Rooms are nothing to write home about - smallish and ascetic (no tea kettle/coffeemaker). But this is typical for a family owned hotel in the Alps, so set your expectations right - you are not going there to sit in the room anyway. Rooms are cleaned promptly and properly. Owners are very friendly and are always there to help with any questions/issues. It is expensive in season, but San Vigilio is not cheap in general. I am taking one star away because of WiFi - it is free, but so slow that it does not work (you always get a timeout). It did not get any better through the whole week we were there. I would prefer to pay for something that works rather than get something unusable for free. Tip: go to Miara ski lift, they have free WiFi near the lift (I actually did this). All in all - great hotel, great service. We will be back (but need to book in advance since it fills up quickly for vacation periods).",family,NEG

"“Great hotel, tradition galore, fantastic food and close to the slopes”","We stayed at this hotel in december 2010 and will be returning there this year. The occasion was the Italian ski season opening at Kronplatz, which is the ski resort this hotel caters for. Maurizio and Theodora, the owners, work very hard to make their guests feel at home and do an excellent job. The hotel is one of the most authentic I have ever stayed, and is beautifully decorated and maintained, partially thanks to Maurizio´s (the owner´s) hobby for collecting old clocks, musical instruments, wines, etc. Al Plan is situated only a two minute walk from the foot of the Miara ski run which opens up the vast Kronplatz ski resort. Distance to the village centre is about 5 minutes´walk. The food here was absolutely fabulous. Breakfast is offered in buffet formula but coffee and tea are freshly brewed for each guest individually (hmmm... great cappucino from the gigantic espresso machine ). Dinners are usually a four-course menu served at the table (starter-soup-mains-dessert) but also include a salad buffet and a complimentary apéritif, not seldom prosecco or alike. The choice of wines is vast and regionally oriented, which can only be applauded. Maurizio has a special wine-and-pool-room which operates as a bar during the day, and you should also explore the wine cellar downstairs where he has installed a special guest table to discover the more exclsuive wines. The spa area, as the rest of the hotel, is exquisitely decorated but I could imagine it being somewhat small if the hotel is fully booked. Especially, the view towards the mountains is stunning while relaxing in the jacuzzi or lying in the lounge chairs. There were only 18 of us at the time so we were fine (I believe the hotel has a 60pax capacity). It´s just great to see this kind of hotel being lovingly operated by their owners, and I have a soft spot for hotels where the accent is put on providing good service and cosy communal areas, instead of upping the rooms with all kinds of gizmos no one ever needs. Due to the rooms being just rooms, this hotel only has a 3-star classification, but the rest of the hotel and the service rendered should make this somewhere between 4 and 5 stars in my opinion. A great stay and we hope to be back many, many times.",friends,POS

In other hotels in the same region (or in Austrian Tirol) the food was really gourmet, and here the food was just good. The rooms were extremely small and the bed wasn't very comfort, especially for the price of the room.

“Like coming home”,"After a long drive we arrived in MONTE SELLA. The hotel is located in a little village but with all the necessary facilities in the village : a few pubs, restaurants, 2 supermarkets etc..The valley it lays in is stunning. Although it is situated along the main road, there's few traffic and the centre is only a 5 minute walk. The rooms are very tidy and when you open the door, you're welcomed by the sweet smell of pine. Some rooms have a balcony which is very pleasant in summer time. There are only a few suites who are brand new and quite superb. Breakfast is plentyful : all sorts of bread even organic, croissants, fresh sliced fruite,pastry,various sorts of cold cuts,cornflakes etc. No hot breakfast however..but I'm sure if you'd ask they would provide it for free. Dinner kicks off with a grand salad buffet (which changes every evening) followed by a first course and a main course and dessert. The menu changes every day and you have the choice for the first and main course and dessert between 3 dishes. Even in the unlickly event that you don't fancy any of the dishes, you have got to ask and they will cook something to your liking. The quality of the food is more than excellent considering it's half board. Some of the dishes we had : spaghetti with baby lobster, ravioli stuffed with ricotta and a superb basil sauce, deer ragout with polenta, chocolate moeullieux, dessert buffet.. I had also a body massage during 50 minutes, a real treat after a whole day walking in the mountains. The wellness facilities are also very good.

Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful and they attended to all our needs right. The room we stayed in (Edelweiss) was very spacious, around 45 sq.mt and we had plenty of room for 2 adults and one child. The daily cleaning service was very good. The hotel also has a beautiful, spotless spa which we enjoyed very much after a long day of skiing. We stayed on a BB basis but we highly suggest their HB. We ended up staying at the hotel for dinner most nights for their executive chef Walter prepared an outstanding 4 course menu every night at a great value. They also had a great breakfast buffet.

My reservation included breakfast and there was always fresh fruit, yogurt and choice of style eggs to suit my vegetarian lifestyle. I also found the wifi to be unreliable UNTIL I turned off private browsing after which it was totally reliable as exemolified by the fact that I could Facetime to the United States without any difficulty.

Including pastries and tea/coffee/espresso style coffee, breads (a variety of grains), and jams, and eggs/cheeses/yogurts/fresh fruits/cereals, etc. If you opted to have some of the meats/cheeses or fruit for example, you were charged the highest amount, which was expensive. There seemed to be a lot of local people who dropped by either at the coffee bar, or out on the outside terrace for coffee or a drink.

“It is a shame...”,"We spent a couple of nights in this hotel- in a double room. The hotel and the room are very clear, comfortable, well equipped. The rooms are spacious and cozy. On our check-in day we were late because of traffic, so we called the hotel to inform them we would be late. We got the hotel, the woman who is the hotel owner showed us the room. We asked her if it’s possible to get something to eat for dinner as we paid a half pension but she answered no. Early in the morning we went skiing as it was the main purpose of our stay there and we came back to the hotel room in the afternoon. The room was cold because the heating was on a minimum during the whole day. We had a short break and went down to dinner at 8.30 p.m. We found a closed restaurant and an unfriendly lady who told us the dinner is over. We were surprised because we very hungry as we spent the whole day skiing. We asked the hotel owner how it is possible the dinner has already been over? It was only 8.30 p.m. She answered the dinner is served only from 6.45. till 8.00 p.m. We asked her why nobody informed us about such an odd period of serving dinner. She just showed us a piece of paper exposed at the front desk where it is written when dinner is served. The lady was completely unfriendly, unprofessional, we asked her if we can get some rests of a dinner, anything to eat as we have already paid the half pension the day of our arrival. She said it is impossible. We had to go out to eat. The hotel is a real disappointment in comparison to a price we paid for, especially the hotel management and service. We paid the half pension without having the two dinners we paid for- without even getting an apology. I have travelled a lot and I come from a tourism region, I have stayed in different types of hotel but I have never seen such unprofessional relation to a guest as well as the rule the dinner is served only from 6.45 till 8.00p.m. when the hotel is full of guests and it is high season.

Step outside the hotel, and you're immediately in the charming old part of Bolzano. Accommodations are simple and elegant, though rooms may appear small to American travelers (but why travel in Europe if you're seeking American-style accommodation)? The breakfast is ample and the food is of high quality--outstanding coffee and cappuccino prepared on the spot by the hotel owners, with fresh-baked local breads, strudel, etc. The stewed apples from local orchards were delicious, and a nice addition.

I know it is about the essentials but little touch ups could be done.

The triple room was quite comfortable with three single beds, a small kitchenette, flat screen TV, wardrobe and huge, deep blue tiled bathroom with a big tub and hand-held shower. Very clean and, most importantly, it had air conditioning, as Bolzano was steamy hot. The air conditioning was turned on by inserting the room key in a slot near the door, so it would shut off once you left the room. Our room was lovely and cool all night.

But as I was already there I made use of it - at least I tried the restaurant with the """"Tiroler Menü"""" which was fantastic! The rooms are big and good equipped. In my room - I guess it was 316, the shower head was fixed very low and had to be removed from the wall while showering ... this is the only negative point I could have if I would be picky.

The ski lift is close (5 min) and we were chauffeured there by the hotel shuttle. After skiing they had afternoon tea already waiting in the bar area which we really enjoyed after a day out on the slopes. Next stop was the spa and pool area which is very generous with a number of different saunas and steam rooms. One night I also had a massage which was absolutely beautiful and surprisingly cheap for a hotel (Euro 52 for 50 min). I also thought the drinks in the bar were very generous: twice the size for only half the price compared to what we have to fork out in Australia. So all up a really fabulous stay.",family,POS

I can't comment on a food quality since we were staying at the apertment and were preparing food by ourself. Hotel is set in a beautiful country, near by ski slopes, minibus connection is great.

“Overbooked and poor servive”,"In July we booked a double room for 2 nights for a special weekend in December. Everything confirmed in writing. On arrival there was a “problem”, and they had not got a double room for us. They had messed up. All they could offer were 2 single rooms for the first night. After long debate we had no option but to accept. The rooms were tiny and looked over the car park roof. There was no apology, no effort to make things right. A simple gesture such as a bottle of wine delivered to our room might have helped us to forgive them – but nothing. On the second day they sent a staff member to move our luggage to the double room, but when we got there it was not made up. We had to take everything back to our single rooms! The final insult was at check-out. They offered to give the 2 single rooms for “half price” which meant they cost the same as the double room we should have had in the first place. In was only after absolute insistence that (a) they had not provided what we booked and (b) we should have some recognition for all they had messed us about that the offered not to charge for the parking. Big deal! Overall the hotel was old fashioned, dingy and extremely overpriced. Breakfast was somewhat chaotic.

Nice reception, pleasant and helpful staff and the lift worked like a charm. Yes, the décor is a bit dated but spotlessly clean. The room spacious and inviting, and we enjoyed the balcony overlooking the well cared for gardens. The bathroom was clean, relatively modern and everything worked well. Good bed, not too soft, we slept rather well. Breakfast was a delight, wonderful and healthy food, nice setting, large windows open to the gardens.

Indeed, everywhere was super clean. The most important items (beds & bathroom fittings) are fully up-to-date. So, we will have no hesitation about rteurning to this hotel.

During our stay the owner was always present and available which made a welcome change from the previous hotel we stayed in where it was difficult to find the manager/owner. We had a large, well appointed room overlooking the swimming pool with wonderful views over the Adige valley to the mountains beyond. We were on half board terms so we ate in the restaurant each evening. The food was superb and very well presented. We sampled the local wines which, although not cheap, are well worth the money. The hotel has a very pleasant terrace to sit on. Meals can be taken on the terrace though we did not try this as both evenings we were there the weather was thundery. All the staff were very friendly and welcoming. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and hope to return someday.

Fantastic food at dinner, but also a very very good picnic (dear to our heart, as we are walkers). Hotel gave us a free card that meant that all transport in and close to Bozen/Bolzano was free, as well as the museums. Cable car down to Bozen is very frequent, efficient, and close to the hotel, and only a short riverside walk to the main town, which is well worth a couple of days visit.

“Fabulous Hotel on the Main Piazza”,"Bolzano, Italy is one of the most charming cities in Northeast Italy. Not only does it have a fantastic view of the piazza, it is as convenient and as charming as the city. The Hotel Greif is a hotel like not other. It is small and you will know the staff by name and they will know you. It is very unique in that every room is different and designed by and artist. Such an interesting vision by the owners to make is stand out among hotels anywhere in the world. The rooms are spacious and open with nice large bathrooms, unlike most hotel in Europe. It has a wonderful breakfast especially prepare for you as you enter. Wonderful fruit and yogurt, cheese and bread, cured meats and breakfast sweets all out and they will prepare eggs. bacon or ham any way that you like. The manager, DORIS GOTTER, is the loveliest woman I have ever met. Not only was she beautiful on the outside, she was warm and lovely on the inside. She would go our of her way to help us with anything and always came by at breakfast and asked if we needed help in any way. She was the special added feature to this hotel. She is really the STAR! We went to Bolzano to try all of the white wines in the Alto Adage region. Some of the best white wines in the world! As an added attraction, see the IceMan museum!

It was ~ 4 blocks from train station (< 10 minute walk) and is right by main sights of Bolzano (old town, cathedral, museums, shopping area, good restaurants). Fantastic breakfast included in room rate. Only downside was that the church bells at 7AM (at least on Sunday AM) and 10 PM (on Saturday PM) - may be on other days as well since we only stayed one night - otherwise hotel was very quiet with windows closed (room overlooks Piazza Walther - so I would image you would hear some noise if ythe windows were open - room is air conditioned.

So instead we took a nice 90 minutes walk to the city centre through a nice industrial area. You need a car or a good taxi budget to stay here. Breakfast was one of the poorer we have had in italy.

One of the staff members, Christian (sp?) was so helpful and accomodating when we arrived in the middle of the night due to a late start and lots of traffic. We called to let them know that we would be late, but as they don't have a 24-hour reception desk, my cousin and I expected to spend the night sleeping in our car. Christian heard us come in and came to greet us with our room keys. The rooms were very nice, clean, and comfortable, each with its own balcony. Because we were facing the road, there were some traffic noises, but not too bad. (Be sure to ask for a room facing the courtyard if that bothers you). The hotel grounds are lovely with a pretty view of the mountains in the background. Breakfast was great! We very much enjoyed drinking coffee on the terrace with view of the mountains. As for the location, it's not right in the city center, but only a few kilometers away. It's great as long as you have a car. Overall, I think this hotel is a great value and the staff is great. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm passing through Bolzano. Room Tip: Request a room facing the courtyard if traffic noises bother you. See more room tips",friends,POS
“Met Expectations but Expensive”,"I stayed in this hotel for one night with my daughter in order to visit the Christmas markets in Bolzano and Merano. It is like all hotels we've ever stayed in while in the Sudtirol and exemplifies the current trend in Sudtirol hostelry...clean, with nice and efficient staff, but expensive (118 Euros for our room). The hotel itself is a bit of a ways outside the city center, on a pretty busy road, so don't expect to be able to walk downtown and the main Bolzano sites from here. We had a double room which while scrupulously clean, was very small and filled with dated, though functional, furniture. Everything in the room worked as it should though, so no complaints there. My daughter and I also sampled the restaurant at the hotel. The dinner at the restaurant was very good and most of the tables were filled with diners, attesting to the quality of the food. Again though, prices were close to exorbitant (16 Euros for a Wienerschitzel w/ French Fries and 3 Euros for a glass of Coke). In fact, you can get much better food deals in just about any restaurant in downtown Bolzano. I will say though, that the service at the hotel was very pleasant, particularly the lady behind the counter which I took to be the proprietor, and they looked after our needs and any request we had quite promptly. The hotel also provides free covered parking to protect vehicles in the winter which is nice to have. Wi-fi internet service is also available but again, not free, though the price for 24 Hour service is not excessive (2 Euros) and the connection is quite strong (I was able to Skype with my wife for long periods with no issues). Finally, all rooms come with breakfast which is your typical European repast of cold cereals, yoghurts, meats, cheeses, and pastries, nothing exceptional here. In closing, I recommend this hotel but will probably look elsewhere to stay in the future as we like to be closer to the city center and prices are comparable in other places in better locations.",family,NEG

Was greeted by old man receptionist screaming at me how dare i to use the stairs with my luggage !!

Really don't know whats the big deal that i used the stairs, is not like they made of gold ! Basic hotel with a big dog wondering in the reception.

“Nice stay”,"We enjoyed our stay at the Business Resort Parkhotel Werth. The positives: AMAZING staff. Every single staff person was incredibly friendly. We had a reserved breakfast table in the morning for our larger group, dinner reservations were made at a lovely nearby restaurant, everyone was just so helpful. And make sure you say hi to Brusco, the hotel dog. He's adorable. The lobby, breakfast room and gardens were very nice, clean and welcoming. The bed was comfortable. The negatives: The rooms were a bit outdated. Our room had two single beds instead of one double. The AC stopped worked a few times during the night and we would have to get out of bed and reset it. Breakfast, while good, was not replenished often enough. For example, there was an amazing spinach pie that was never replaced after the first dish was finished. Breakfast was served until 10am, but around 930 most items stopped being replenished. Nice stay, perfect for our needs. Don't know if I would consider it a 4 star hotel though.",friends,NEG
“Overpriced”,"The hotel is in a good position, near the airport of Bolzano. Free parking and wifi. Very good breakfast. The rooms are spacious, a little retro but ok. The problem with this hotel is service (except restaurant). For example we ate breakfast and we went to our room to get ready to go out. When we came back the entrance was locked and we couldnt find anyone to let us out. After half an hour waiting we managed to go out from the fire escape in the parking basement. Then, we came late (not to late 22:00) at night. There was nobody in reception the doors where locked and we had no info what to do in this case.

“Avoid if possible”,"Despite a good location on the outskirts of Bolzano, and also despite a lovely appearance from the outside, I found everything else to do with this hotel awful. Firstly, the pillows are so gigantic they force your neck into an extremely awkward position and guarantee a bad night's sleep on this factor alone. It was hot when I stayed and the air con was not working properly - not something you expect in this price range. Then there was the food: it is rare to eat so badly in Italy (or Germany for that matter) - the steak was passable, but was served with canteen style veggies at an upmarket hotel price. Finally, as a Scotch lover, I would have expected a small selection to choose from at a hotel in this range - they had one or two random blended. All in all, a horribly overpriced experience. I would not have given this place even two stars: best avoided!",None,NEG
"“Nice stopover, but not long stay”","Staid here for one night as stopover on a business trip. Good things were: clean rooms, nice view outside. Its a very new and modern building.

"“Beautiful, clean, friendly!”","Awesome experience at Hotel Eberle! Very friendly, helpful, and accommodating staff. Everyone we talked to did their best to help us and answer our questions. The room was spacious and clean, and the beds were comfortable. Several windows in our room allowed us to have fresh air coming in when we wanted it. We arrived late one night without having eaten dinner, and although the restaurant was closing, they let us order some pizza (the salmon one was AWESOME) and beer after we checked in. Breakfast in the morning was also delicious, with lots of variety. And the view from the restaurant seating (indoor and outdoor) was a spectacular panorama of the town of Bolzano and the surrounding mountains. Because the hotel is on the mountain, there are some hiking options very easily accessible from right outside the hotel. Though it has a beautiful view being on the mountainside, getting from the hotel to the town center is slightly more challenging than if you were to stay in the town center. However, they would call a taxi for us when we needed it. We walked from the hotel down the hill into town and it only took about 10-15 minutes. Getting back up the hill can be more difficult of course, but we found that taxis were always close by the train station when you needed one. The only thing that could make this hotel better would be an occasional shuttle from town to the hotel, but we did fine without one! Otherwise, no complaints!

It was an easy walk to town too. The reception is not manned 24 hours so we had to wait for staff to arrive to check out. We used the garage for our care at an extra cost but the area was a bit busy and we felt safer with it locked away.

The owners, Karl and Margot, were very welcoming and extremely helpful. They made our stay so enjoyable. We ate dinner in their charming dining room, the food prepared by chef Karl was excellent. The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have ever seen, with a number of choices, all delicious! As a side note, I would like to say the people we met in Bolzano were incredible. We walked from the hotel to the museum to see the Otzi exhibition, and got lost; a resident who did not speak English but understood where we wanted to go, walked us much of the way. going at least 15 minutes out of his way.

The underground garage is superb. But...... Arriving after a long drive we were disappointed to discover that the restaurant is closed on Mondays (maybe it says this on the web site but we didn't see it). The suites, although large, are a bit sterile, the big lounge was crying out for a coffee table but instead there was just an open space. There was a vast amount of wall space but no long dressing mirror. The WiFi connection in the suites is very unstable.

“Humble is overrated statement.”,"The Magdalener Hof in northern Bolzano, Italy has been losing its grip on the hospitality trends for the past 3 to 4 years. On my recent stay October 18. 2013, I was shocked by the declining attention to guest and dysfunctional fixtures in the rooms 155 and 156. When the discomforts were addressed with the management and the owner, family Ramoser, it was left without response or explanation for the noted deficiencies. While the Magdalener Hof presents itself at the level of Crown Plaza or similar 3 plus star properties the reality is quite different, outright declining.

It's lovely! See more room tips,family,POS
“We don't do that kind of thing here in Bolzano...”,"That explained the absence of a fridge, coffee/tea making gear, iron etc. in our room. Zip. Zero. That was on our second visit to the front desk. A decidedly more cheery encounter than on check-in. Should we have said “buongiorno” or “guten tag” given this was the South Tyrol? Or should I have said “gruss gott” (literally – may God greet you) and branded myself a Bavarian? The third one was just a bridge too far for an ageing, stinking atheist like me. We left check-in feeling we had just been granted the favour of accommodation. Indifference has its place but definitely not at Reception. Nor at check-out either, as it turned out. The hotel is long walk with luggage from the train station. Far better to catch a taxi. Its location puts it in a quiet part of the city – about 20-25 minutes’ walk from the underwhelming Piazza Walther in the Centre. But, on that walk, you will have to pass the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology. Do not pass this place without visiting. Here you will find, Otzi, the 5000 years old Ice Age man. Far and away one of the best exhibitions you will see. Post Gries has a bar and restaurant. At the front there is a nice, small bakery, and a health food shop and useful café behind the hedge. More importantly, about 3 minutes’ walk up the Corsa della Liberta, there is the Despar supermarket. If you are desperate for food and you probably will be, it’s well worth a visit. There are a few bars in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. Our room spoke of that Nordic, minimalist design. Comfortable and clutter-free. Plenty of pale wood, lots of white stuff everywhere, very modern and very, very clean. The shower recess was roomy with excellent water pressure. The AC was quiet and oh-so cold. Breakfast was themed German and Italian. Adequate but the chairs are small and uncomfortable. The hotel appears to be well patronised, popular with groups from Northern Europe. Lots of baby-boomers in Lycra, wrapped in thermo skins, armed with walking sticks, mountain bikes and parachutes stuffed into the back of the Volvos. Here am I thinking mountains are for skiing down, yodelling and demolishing vast amounts of fondue and gluhwein. Not so, apparently. I‘d like to enthuse about Post Gries but I can’t. If the management would put the fridge back, provide the items we come to expect as standard, make breakfast a leisurely, comfortable experience and cheer up then they might be justified in charging a premium. Overall, I give it a very good rating, but with provisos. I don’t know if I would come back to the Post Gries. Nor Bolzano in summer. I think it all does better in winter. Tip: Take the cable car ride to what is laughingly called Upper Bolzano. Once you get in the cable car and begin the near vertical ascent, you’ll appreciate just how much these South Tyroleans enjoy understatement. Upper Bolzano is manicured, picture-postcardy, flowerboxed, and stunning panoramas of the valley and the Dolomites. The cable car station is about 1 km from the train station.",couple,NEG
"“Good value, a little out of the way.”","This was our second trip to Bolsano and our second time to this hotel. Upon arriving the first time we were a little concerned that the center of town was quite a walk. However, we found the hotel has a clever set up for calling a taxi and we never had to wait more than a few minutes, and the cab ride was only a few minutes. The two receptionists were terrific and very helpful. The hotel has free parking underground which seemed quite secure. They allowed us to store our bicycles in another garage as well. The facility is clean and modern. The breakfast buffet was top notch as well. Room Tip: As of June 2014 there is a construction project next door. It might be wise to request a room away f...

"“Nothing wrong, nothing outstanding”","This hotel is not a bad choice at all. The service is friendly, the rooms are neat and the breakfast really good. Parking is free which is good and there is WIFI, but not the best that we've experienced on your trip. There's a bus stop close by, but you can also walk through the city which is nice. The rooms don't have everything you need. There's no iron and also no fridge. Will consider to stay here again on a next visit, but will certainly also look at other options.",couple,NEG
"“Clean, efficient and helpful”","I stayed here for a week on a cycling exploration of the Dolomites, sharing a self-catering apartment with three others. Our apartment was well above average, with a large living area and a balcony. We ate two meals a day at the hotel, all of which were more than sufficient to fuel a demanding cycling itinerary. Breakfast is a European-style buffet, dinner, a changing three-course menu. I wouldn't take someone to dine at the hotel if I were visiting the town, but for day-in-day-out eating, it was more than fine. The hotel lent us a garage in which to keep our bikes, which was enormously useful and much appreciated. There was always someone on reception who spoke reasonable English. Free wifi is available, but only in reception. As an early riser, it was fine to do my emails before breakfast and cycling. Were I not out all day, I would have grown irritated by having to work in the public gaze. The hotel is nearly on the edge of Bolzano, and a good 15 minute walk to the centre of the Old Town. No problem, if you have a bike with you, or you are touring by car. Walking in an out of the town centre twice daily, however, might be a pain.",friends,POS
“Nice Establishment”,This hotel was a nice place to stay. It was pricy for the room as well as the dinners that they prepared. On the other hand the food was excellent and I understand was the typical cuisine for this area. The room was small and the shower cramped. Plumbing leaked in the shower and the toilet. It had been like this for a while. We were charged 10 euro per day for our dog even though we did not have the room cleaned until we left. The front desk staff was helpful and spoke excellent english. The bus stop is on the street in front of the hotel. It was easy to get to downtown and back.,couple,NEG
“unfriendly at times”,"We stayed a week. The room was small and fine, nice balcony. tiny Bathroom and okay Breakfast. I would not stay again. The owners wife was unfriendly at times. Perhaps we were expected to have Dinner at the Hotel every night. We ate one ..it was okay. The Weisse Roessel in Bolzano was outstaning and we ate there three times.",friends,NEG
“Not value for money”,"The break-fast was disppointing and for the amount we were charged, we definitely expected more. The atmosphere was dull. Room was bit noisy and there is noview of Dolomites, whatsoever. It was clean. I would personally pay not more than Euro 60 per night.",couple,NEG
“Bolzano weekendtrip”,"we stayed for a 5 days long weekend in Bolzano at Rentschnerhof. Perfect situated in the hills above Bolzano, with a beautiful view over the city and the vinyards. Just 20 minutes walking or 5 minutes by bus (stop directly in front of the hotel) to the city center. Swimmingpool allows you to relax from hot summer days, service is very good, family owned and family feeling, rooms sunny and with terrace/balcony. Gorgeous view from the restaurant which is serving agreeable standard cuisine. We can recommend the place and will come back for sure.",couple,NEG
“Great hotel for winter vacations...”,"I was in this hotel in Januar, 2012 for skiing vacations on Kronplatz. We stayed in new part of hotel, and it was beatiful and modern. Breakfest was nice and dinner also. There is sauna and swimming pool that are also great. You can use garage even for cars with thule(ski box). Every morning you have free ski shuttle to perca ski station. At the end it was nice ski vacation.",couple,POS
"“Great snow, great stay in the hotel”","My choice my responsibility as my family said. And I won! Althoug the beginning was bad but after moving to new part of hotel it was perfect stay. Than no blaming from my wife and son. Quite big comfort room w(ith separeted by small wall part for another bed) was very comfortable. The only funny thing was glass door to shower/bath room (oh! my nose remember it!) and I could watch my wife in the bath when I was laying on the bed! Everything in the hotel was clean. Swimming pool is devided for two parts - indoor and outside, both open in the winter time. There are few types of sauna and I liked them very much. Breakfast was very good, big choice and not identical every day. And the best point of the hotel were dinners. Started at 19:00 and usually took 2 hours! But every course was worth of every minute waiting! One of my favorite kitchen in my life. I reccomend it to anybody. Service was very good.

“Great place”,"Stayed at the hotel in January 2011 with a group from Vicenza Italy. The accommodations were more than great. We stayed in the older part of the hotel, and it was still a very nice room. Of course when you visit Brunico for skiing/snowboarding, you don't spend a lot of time in your room. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. The staff was 1st Class and treated you very nicely. It was definitely a family affair. The wellness center in the basement, consisting of an indoor/outdoor pool, sauna, steam rooms, solariums and massage parlors was very nice. The meals were of excellent quality and they came out pretty quickly. One thing to remember is that when you decide to go with half board, understand that they serve more than one type of dinner meal, and the one with 5 courses isn't the one for half board, its a little bit more, but not by much. All in all, it was a great experience and I plan to stay there again next winter.",None,POS

“Impossible to fault this hotel”,"I was going to write a lengthy report on the Preidlhof but having read the review dated 13th August that covered most of what I wanted to say. I do want to add that this is an excellent hotel. It has a massive underground car park with allocated parking spaces identified by your room number. The accommodation at the hotel is in two separate buildings with an inside walk-way along corridors and stairs to the main building where the restaurants are located. You can also walk round the outside of the building. The distance from our room to the restaurant would be around 250m. Our room, 701, was a magnolia west facing suite. We decided to book this to take advantage of the evening sun but this was not possible as there was a large hill outside the hotel and the sun disappeared behind that. Having said that we were shaded for most of the day from the intense sun, which we were pleased about as we were experiencing temperatures around 33C. The pools are fantastic and we spent a lot of time in them cooling off. Hardly anyone uses the indoor pool, which has underwater music. I would advise you to wear ear plugs as I caught an ear infection, which the Dr described as swimmers ear. I am not saying that the pool was dirty it was not infact it was very clean. I just picked up an infection and it may prevent you from having your time spoiled from a similar complaint. We had a couple of spa treatments during our stay we felt that they were worth the money and helped us. All of the staff were brilliant, helpful and polite. This was our honeymoon and they tried very hard to make it special for us. This included a bottle of champagne on arrival, a decorated bed and our restaurant table decorated differently every evening for our 10 day stay, all on a romantic theme. The only gripe that I have is that they insist on charging you E 3.50 for a jug of tap water with your evening meal. Also tea and coffee in your room is charged as an extra, as it is with the evening meal. I would expect this to be free in a hotel of this standard. Also the treatments are described in German and Italian but not in English so it is a little difficult if you don't speak these languages. The hotel is set in a major apple growing area and all along the valley there are acres and acres of apple trees, which were being harvested during our stay at the end of August. There was entertainment on several evenings during the week. A saxophonist, pianist and singer. A special hotel in every way.",couple,POS
"“For Ski lovers, come here every year for a week of skiing in IT”","We are a group of 20-25 ski lovers who come to St. Vigilio every year /past 7 years/ and always stay at this nice hotel. Rooms are very clean and cozy, clean towels every day. The owner does not mind serving us early breakfast in order to catch the first bus to the slopes. Very convenient if you ski at Kronplatz as the ski bus stop is right at the hotel, so no need to walk too far. At the same time if you wish to ski in the surrounding areas its just close by /alta badia, corvarajust 30 mind drive by car/ access to Arraba, Sellaronda. Cortina just 1 hour of drive.

The owner, Yogi, is a wonderful host, the cuisine is impeccable and the rooms just lovely, in their rustic style. It is such a friendly place that every year it feels like returning to family.

The location - backed up against the mountainside, about 1/2 hour from Meran - was great, the grounds of the hotel were beautiful, flowering plants everywhere, right in the middle of apple orchards. The room was looking over the swimming pools, had a huge bathroom, very comfortable large bed, plenty of room. They even supplied a backpack and thermos for use while there. There are 6 or 7 different saunas and steambaths, a very fanciful indoor pool, 2 outdoor pools including a waterfall, great workout room. The spa offered all different kinds of massages, etc. The restaurant served 2 different 7 (!!) course meals every night, you can mix the courses,too. The food was the best we have ever had in a hotel, wine was also good and not too expensive. The staff was great - my husband had our (grown) two daughters join us for my birthday, the staff """"hid"""" them to be sure I wouldn't see them before my birthday breakfast.

"“Lovely, friendly, modern yet traditional hotel”","I stayed with two friends in the Resa Blancia for a week during a recent trip to the Kronplatz ski area in the Italian Dolomites. The hotel has a traditional ambience, but has been renovated so that all amenities are modern. My (single) room was spacious, warm, clean and well-maintained, with satellite TV (albeit without English language channels) and a nice balcony. We were well-fed during the week, with the staff coping well with my (to them unfamiliar) vegetarian diet - they went out of their way to ensure I was happy. The staff were very friendly and helpful, to the extent we got hugs and kisses when we left. The rates were very reasonable, and when one of my friends had to return to the UK for three days during the visit to deal with an unexpected family issue, the proprietress discounted his bill, even though he hadn't asked for it. The principal language locally is the dialect Ladin, though most people speak German or Italian, with little English routinely spoken. There is a 'wellness' centre in the hotel which we didn't use, but which looked very nice. The ski bus stops outside, so getting to the main (Miara) gondola is straightforward, though you need to buy a ticket from the hotel as this isn't included in the ski pass. Oh, and like most places in that area, no wifi - you have to go to the little local library, open intermittently during the week.

Ample opportunity for great mountain hikes. And the food ! six courses every night, but so light and healthy that you don't feel stuffed. Did I mention very tasty? The whole experience is extremely good value for money. it is huge and widely spread out. From our room to the restaurant it was quite a puzzle the first time to find our way through long connecting corridors and various elevators. Not difficult to get lost. The signs could be improved. Their service reaches as far as supplying each room with a professional backpack for hiking. One weird thing though: bring cash, because they don't accept credit cards. Makes you wonder in this day and age.",couple,POS
“Don't bother”,"Hotel is on the corner of a fairly busy road, so you get some road noise. On arriving, the lady at the bar had to call upstairs for the guy to come down to reception. On two separate occasions my husband had to go downstairs to try and get the phone in our room to work and both times this same routine - surely it should be easier to be able to speak to reception? Phone still didn't work. Hotel has an old look about it, you walk in via a bar where people sitting there all look at you coming in. We advised upon booking that we were vegan and were told that wouldn't be a problem, similarly upon arriving we restated the fact, and the man at reception very cheerfully said this would be fine, no worries. Got down to breakfast in the morning to one table set- suggesting we were the only ones having breakfast... and our options were yoghurt, packaged croissants with egg and milk in them, bread, and a small bowl of fruit. We asked for cereal and they brought this out from the kitchen. We then had to ask for bowls, and for spoons (and were given tea-spoons) and for milk. They did manage to get us some soy milk so this was appreciated. Internet is pretty slow, and the shower was low pressure, water went all over the floor, and when you turned around, the tap was perfectly situated so your leg would bump it to maximum heat. Great if you want to be scalded in the morning. Meh, go somewhere else.",couple,NEG

“Ultra comfortable high quality accomodation with cosy atmosphere”,"We stayed at the St Veit for the first - but surely not the last - time when on a three week roadtrip in Austria and northern Italy. We had booked a week in Sexten, and the stay exceeded all our expectations. We were overwhelmed with the high level of quality and service. The staff is extremely friendly and the owners have not failed in creating a truly cosy atmosphere. We were at half board which was good value for money. An excellent and extensive breakfast, an afternoon cake buffet and a five course dinner were all included, as was the use of the very nice wellness area. I will give extra points for the decision to separate the sauna and relax areas from the indoor swimmingpool, and for allowing children in the pool only. That way the spa really becomes a place to relax. Children were not forgotten; there was a playroom and a Kino showing movies for the small ones. At the meals, extra attention was given to potential allergies, and any special requests, such as glutenfree or laktosfree meals, were happily catered for. Our room had a large balcony with a beautiful mountain view. Waking up looking out of the window from the bed was a wonderful experience each and every morning.

Restaurant and food is great, really delicious, big variety and high quality.

“Top Class”,"Stayed at Hotel Alpenblik in September of this year for one week. The booking was effortless. Upon arrival we were met by the Owner who showed us the facilities on our way to the room. He was extremely polite although a little reserved. The room was very large, clean and well appointed. We had a large balcony with a beautiful view of the Sextner dolomites. Our room was in the annex which was connected by an underground passageway to the main part of the hotel. The hotel had a wonderful Sauna and relaxation area separated from the swimming pool. The area was kept well maintained and clean - bathrobes and clean sauna towels were provided daily. A nice touch was a button with your room number which ensured that your bathrobe could be easily identified from other guests. The pool area was pleasant although a little warm for our tastes the temperature of the indoor/outdoor pool was however perfect. The food however requires special mention - it was excellent and consistently of extremely high quality - A five course dinner was on often every evening and there was always sufficient choice. The salad buffet was one of the most extensive I have ever seen in similar Mountain hotels. All guests were invited one evening into the Kitchen to see the Chefs preparing appetisers after which they accomplished a full service. Every evening they offered a wine suggestion at reasonable prices. What we really appreciated is that you were never embarrased to ask for tap water - the hotel provided a tasteful tap and adequate Carafes in the buffet area to allow you to tap your own wonderful sweet mountain water. The dinning room was large, pleasant and comfortable - evening meals were a wonderfully relaxed affair. At breakfast there was a chef on hand to cook eggs to order, including omlettes or even pancakes or waffles. The breakfast buffet had ample choice of cold meats cheeses etc. The hotel advertises itself as 3/4 pension, it could honestly state that it is full pension. In the late afternoon there is an extensive array of cakes, pastries, small cold savoury dishes or if you prefer something warm fresh pasta is cooked upon order. The kitchen staff were very friendly and helpful. Our waiter spoke good English and was always ready to translate the menu whenever required. The bar area and lounge was warm and relaxed.

The South Tyrol Tourist Board work hard to promote and market the region in the U.K. and it was on their advice that we were directed towards Sesto and ultimately Hotel Alpenblick which is next to Sesto in Moos. This hotel is set in one of the most beautiful parts of Italy in the heart of the Dolomites with perhaps its roots still in Austria. The hotel itself deserves its 4* superior status with its professional, cordial service that is friendly but not intrusive. Attention to detail is the norm - the hotel is kept clean and tidy with modern furnishings and beautiful flowers with a high standard of hygiene throughout the hotel including the pools and wellness areas. It was the food that we looked forward to most after a day's walking; the food was sublime! Our compliments to the Chef who provided a huge variety of dishes that never bored or dulled our senses. Even the children's menu consisted of 'proper food' in a simpler style that would suit even the most fastidious of eaters. Breakfast was plentiful with ample choice on offer and the Afternoon Tea was much more than a snack with savouries and delicious tiny desserts, making this worthy of returning back for from a day out. Hotel complimentary bikes is the only thing I would add, even for low level cycling to potter to nearby villages on the days you don't walk.

Being there on half board meant that we also got a nice dinner and nice breakfast. These meals were good and perfectly suited to the family run ambience.

“Second division”,"Stayed in the hotel with our two young children July 09. Originally booked into suite in the self-catering wing. Rejected our first room (incredibly gloomy) and ended up rejecting the second - both were gloomy, smelling of stale smoke, with tired furnishings. Stayed in hotel section instead - by far the better choice despite costing almost the same. Only drawback is obligatory half board, which is a slow five-course affair, with obligatory dumpling (different colour each day) and surly staff.

The staff were extremely friendly and obliging, and the food was delicious. I had the three-night B&B package, which is great value and includes one dinner - the lavish """"Degustationsmenü"""". I immediately booked for another three nights. On the Friday they did a seafood menu - eight courses. Simpler options were always available and they were also good. The breakfast included croissants that were the stuff that dreams are made of. I heartily recommend this hotel.",None,POS
“Old hotel in central Sesto.”,"We found the hotel through an internet booking service for a tree day stay. Our uses of the hotel were bed, breakfast and dinner – we were out in the mountains all day long. The Sesto/Sexten valley and mountain surrounding must be almost the most fantastic area of the Dolomites! Seen from internet the hotel is more impressive than in real. It has though a very nice looking from front outside and the lobby and service, dinner area is OK but nothing more. The floors above are less impressive and our room and balcony did not have the same appearance or standard. There car parking is not outside the hotel but on the other side of the river (out of view). You will be greeted with smiles and especially at breakfast and dinner with service. Both breakfast and dinner is varied with several choices and very good! WiFi: The hotel have wifi but not in our room and their knowledge to give us correct info (id, password) was not good so for once we gave up the mail and internet news… The wellness area we did not use.",couple,NEG
“Superb value/price skiing holiday!”,"We've been going to Strobl Hotel for many years and never been disappointed. The hotel is a 3 floors building well seated in the picturesque village of Sesto (or Sexten) . It's not fancy, but has nice wooden interior, clean rooms and very friendly staff (starting from owners sisters Sabine and Marialuisa). One of its highlights is the cuisine: above its 3 star-level, amazing 5 courses dinners and rich and vary breakfast. The wellness area is nice and cozy, even if not big. Still it offers sauna, Turkish bath and other amenities. The location too is great, almost all rooms have stunning views to the Dolomite mountains. And it is at walking distance from everything (actually the village is rather tiny anyway). The hotel has excellent combo offers nights+skipass, such as 4 night for the price of 3 (before high xmas season). Parking is outside, so in winter you might need to dig the show away from your car, but that is about the negative points I could name. Definitely worth visiting!

“Too many better options in the area”,"Stayed here while taking a break from hiking higher up, with daughter and husband. I did not warm to this place. It was certainly clean, but the food was not up to the standards I have gotten used to in this region (Italian night was especially bad) and the style and decor of the hotel felt bland, if a bit cold and 1960's ish. A lot of pushing and upselling of doing half-board. I also felt a bit """"nickel and dimed"""" with various excess charges (1 Euro 50 for a carafe of tap water at every meal, for example), none of which happened anywhere else on a month long trip in south tyrol. Staff was pleasant, reaching into your wallet with a smile and a good stated reason. Internet service was strangely poor (you pay a fee per hour, but even when you pay, it doesn't work well on various devices). Very cranky and not--very skilled wait staff, especially at the """"just okay"""" breakfast. The village itself was pretty, but dull. I saw so many more interesting, prettier places to stay, so many more interesting choices for food and such, that this stay was the low point of our trip. Overall, I thought this was overpriced for what we got. There is no pool. There are a couple of days of great day-hiking to be had based here, but you could just as easily do the same walks based out of Innichen/San Candido.",family,NEG
“Outstanding place to stay in Sexten”,"First, Sexten is a delightful village in South Tyrol well worth visiting for the clear air and the Dolomites to hike and climb in. If you do, stay at the Strobl, a jewel of a small hotel. Rooms come with breakfast, and that means some of those great breads the German-speaking areas are famous for, and also some great jams, including a homemade strawberry jam worth the trip in itself. The hotel's dining room serves an outstanding dinner, one of the best in town, but it can be hard to get a seat. Overall an outstanding experience.",None,POS
“We had great time in Strobl!”,"I had a conference in Sesto and chose Strobl for its proximity to the conference site. We had a wonderful stay (five nights) in Strobl! Dinner/breakfast (included in the rate) are excellent and waiters/waitresses are so nice and thoughtful. They even attempted to pronounce my last name, which is not easy for Americans but seems easier for Italians. You cannot beat the view/price in Sesto. We were surprised at its lack of fame in the State. We will certainly come back in the future!",None,POS

Good food as well both for breakfast, but also for dinner : original and well prepared Austian-German style based... Relaxing place als in spa area with a couple of sauna, relax area including apples dish and cold-warm showers, no more and no swimming pool.

“Perfect as always!”,"I stayed in the strobl apartments a few weeks ago for the sixth time. The rooms are excellent, they are spacious, clean, bright and well thought out. There's a small kitchen so you can cook when you need to and is just a short walk (150m) to the supermarket and bakery that sells the most amazing bread! We go in winter but the heaters keep the rooms cosy and warm! There are many options close by for dinner I reccomend Eric's for delicious pizza! There is also a small bar called the mula close by that has the most fantastic atmosphere and yummy light snacks like soup and cheese platters.....

The service at strobl is exeptional as well and I would fully reccomend for anyone interested to stay here.",None,POS
“An absolute gem”,"This family hotel is in a quiet street in the centre of Sesto, a very good, but perhaps little known (to non-Europeans) walking area in the Dolomites. The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive, and helpful re local walks. The rooms are reasonably spacious, very clean and beautifully decorated in northern Italian style. Our room had a balcony with views over the village and up the valley. It was a wonderful suntrap for late afternoon reading. When we arrived at the hotel my husband had tooth ache and the staff spent half an hour tracking down dentists in neighbouring villages and and making appointments. The breakfasts are excellent with local cheese, speck, eggs cooked to order and wonderful breads, brioche, pastries, yogurts, muesli and so on. We took the half board option which included excellent five course dinners each night, with a vegetarian option. Excellent wine list including very good local/ regional wines, which were very reasonable priced. There is also a spa/ sauna area, which our friends used and said was very good. it is no WIFI but there is computer access in the lounge area, at a small cost. We left a USB stick there and staff found it, identified it as ours, emailed us to notify us, and then sent it back to us. Amazing service. It has a large car park (free) opposite the hotel.

“best family holiday!!”,"We just arrived home from a wonderful week at the family resort rainer, we had a great experience in this hotel in every sense... children SKI COURSE: arranged by the hotel took our daughter at 10:00am until 12:30 then there was the possibility of leaving her in the kids club that also took them outside in the afternoon until 18:00 it was well organized and she had so much fun. Kids Club: I must say thank you to Veronica she is a stage and only staying for a month but she was great with our son, she was very sweet and took really good care of him, he liked her very very much :) SPA: Maria who did a facial to me was really good very professional and with lots of knowledge, I was really happy!! Dining: Food was plenty and with lots of variety even if my kids didnt eat much there is a nice kids buffet with pasta, meat, soups, vegetables, fries etc... that changed every day, for adults we chose in the morning what we wanted for dinner. Breakfast was great as well, the staff int he restaurant was superb helpful fast... If you have small children under 3 years and you want to have dinner a bit more relaxed from 19:30 until 20:15 you can leave them on the kids club is not a long time (wish we could left him a bit more!!) but enough to have a relaxed dinner... Our 3 year old could stay until 22:00 and she enjoyed it so much doing crafts watching a movie or playing with other children room: we stayed at the 402 LOVELY all wooden very comfy beds nice and clean bathroom with great views to the beautiful mountains... Surroundings : stunning mountains great place to skii from the hotel you can get straight to croda rossa and go up and ski in this amazing and beautiful mountains really breathtaking. The family Rainer is always around Verenna Rainer is like super woman she was everywhere reception, restaurant, childrens excursions skii courses... all we can say is good things about this family that works with passion and great organization.

“A real disappointment”,"I have spent my holidays in the area for many years, and have always enjoyed the beautiful scenery, great skiing in the winter and fantastic trekking in the summer. I was curious about this hotel I had always seen from the outside while passing by and it was a real disappointment and also a source of embarassment as we had brought along some friends (two teenagers with us, so no children involved). No welcome at all upon arrival, almost a cold shoulder upon check in. Very old furniture inside, the rooms too; everything needs some good refurbishing. What was really bad is that the whole hotel was full of flies going everywhere in the restaurant area, in the bar, etc… When we complained about it we were told that in the mountains there are cows who attract flies… Like I said, I have been in the area many times and have NEVER seen flies in a hotel, even less in a supposedly 4S hotel. The pool was new and ok. Dinner was ok, with a wide choice of food, if only there were no flies all over the Bauern buffet... We paid a very high price even though in July, and I was really looking forward to going home.",family,NEG
“Stylish little hideaway”,"We stayed here for 8 days to do some hiking. Our room in-style was very spacious, tasteful furnished with wooden floors and had two balconies with fantastic views. Food and wine were on a very high standard. Extras are reasonably priced (e.g. cable LAN, minibar). The family running this hotel and staff were very nice at all times and even offered free extra services usually not expected. Any negatives? Not really, just minor things to improve. Hence: 5* Recommendation! And hiking was fantastic too. DCTS",couple,POS
“Top Hotel in Dolomiti”,"We spent a week in Monika in early July. Everything was perfect. The hotel is situated in very peaceful area between Sesto and Moso. You can easily reach both cable cars (Monte Elmo and Croda Rossa) on foot. Excellent family Tiroler hotel lies in an idyllic and quiet position between large meadows and the Sesto river. From the hotel Monika and most of the rooms you enjoy a view to the Fiscalina valley and at the top of Monte Elmo. The rooms are tastefully designed, unusually spacious, fully equipped and spotlessly clean. The same is true for the swimming pool and sauna area, which are also beautifully designed. All of the staff members are very friendly, while the young and charming hotel manager is extraordinarily helpful and eager to please. The great surprise though was the dinner. We had booked half board. The dinner was a five or six course gourmet dinner of world class. Every course was inventive, fresh and just amazingly delicious. The hotel offers additional services such as Shuttle Bus service, free parking, SPA, Spa Active gym, guided nordic walking tours and other special activities free of charge. With the Three Peaks Card you may use all public buses, trains, and cable cars. The ideal and quiet position of the Hotel Monika, very close to walking, hiking and cycling trails in summer, cable car to the Monte Elmo (just at a few minutes walk from the hotel Monika) . Massive rock formations such as the Cima Nove, Dieci, Undici, Dodici and Uno, renown as the Sesto sun dial, await you! Above this unique mountain sun dial the Cima Tre Scarperi towers. The wonderful val Fiscalina leads up to the rock faces, and is a comfortable entrance to the Nature Park Sextener Dolomiten, the location for hikes and climbs in the Dolomites.The peaks and alpine plateaus can also be reached with cable cars. The Monte Baranci cable cars near San Candido, the Monte Elmo cable cars near Sesto , and the Croda Rossa cable cars near Moso. During our hikes we can not only enjoy the fantastic view, but also a tasty snack in one of the huts. After a demanding mountain hike of relaxation in the swimming pool was the best reward. A nice swimming pool with an outside jacuzzi are close to sauna area. Sesto is a paradise for people who look for relaxation and still wish to be active. This hotel does not need advertising, it´s Top hotel ! We would like to thank Egarter family and the team of the Hotel Monika for a a relaxing and very delightful stay at our Hotel.",couple,POS
“Incredible value for money”,"At the outside, Hotel Monika is one of the many hundreds Tiroler hotels in the area, white washed walls, timber balconies and wide roofs. The reception area and lounge are also quite conventional. The rooms, however, at least those I have seen, are tastefully designed, unusually spacious, fully equipped and spotlessly clean. The same is true for the swimming pool and sauna area, which are also beautifully designed. All of the staff members are very friendly, while the young and charming hotel manager is extraordinarily helpful and eager to please. The great surprise though was the dinner. We had booked half board. The dinner was a five or six course gourmet dinner of world class. Every course was inventive, fresh and just amazingly delicious, while the sommelier helped us to select some of the best wines of Italy. Try the “Kaid”, a dark red, robust wine from Sicily, a delight and very reasonably priced. The next day, the feast was repeated, another superb five course dinner. When I checked out, I got a bill for Euro 115 per day plus the wines. I told the receptionist that he had inadvertently forgotten to charge breakfast and the dinners. He smiled and said that it was all included!! The bill was very cheap for just the room. So, we had these delicious dinners for free. To call that a bargain is an understatement.

“Excellent!”,"I just came home from one week vacation at hotel Monika in Sesto in the northern part of Italy. I highly recommend anyone to stay there, we stayed in the spa suite which was the same standard as a design hotel in a bigger Europen city. The five dinner course that we had every evening, was better then most restaurant I have visit around the area. (like the Michellin restaurant Tivoli in Cortina that I don't will bother to visit again) The service is amazing and even if the hotel is a small """"cozy alpine feeling"""" the service matches a Ritz hotel. I will defiantly visit Monika again and don't see why you should choose anything else. Things you might need to know + the gym is good, but small if you are in need of more equipment + the spa area is a bit small but have anything you might want. + all the tv channel is in italian or german + a little bit sluggish wifi connection but it works fine But don't worry the staff will do anything to help you out if you have any specific wishes. They helped us out with rental car, taxi, birthday celebration, private wine testing when we didn't had time to show up on their ordinary wine testing in the afternoon.The slopes are just on the other side of the road (400 meter) and I don't see how anyone can be disappointed if they choose hotel Monika in Sesto.",family,POS
“What a great theatrical experience”,"We are half-way through a 2 week stay at the Hotel Holzer. We are not usually great fans of hotels and the associated impersonal experiences but that is not the case when you stay with the Holzers. Every aspect of our stay has been managed with style and simplicity. We are staying here with old friends from Berlin and their family but we have no doubt that we would have received the same attentive experience if we were travelling alone from Australia. Every day is a new and delightful experience and the care the Holzers and their entire staff take is like being at the theatre - every single day. Nicole and Stefan are actors in the best possible way. Every person is a wanted guest and there is often a little attention to personal detail that makes you feel so wanted - 2 apples and chocolates in your room everyday, for instance. For us Australians it was the courtesy of having the napkins folded in the shape of the Sydney Opera House for one evening meal. All of the staff are confident in their work, helpful and friendly. The rooms are sizeable, clean and made up every day. The entire Hotel is as clean as could be and you should take the chance to walk from floor to floor looking at the family curios and collectables. It really is like a small museum. The absolute delight of every day is the dining room. At breakfast there is a wide range of cereals, fruits, bread, ham and cheese with fresh boiled eggs. At dinner the food is first class and delivered from a spotless, well-run kitchen. Three cheers for the chefs who deliver consistently good and creative food without any repeats, so far, in the week we are here. From Stefan's guided walk, Nicole's wonderful style and costumes, the smiling flair of the serving staff, the creativity of the chefs - we could not be happier. Evey day as we said is like going to the theatre. We are loving our time here in the Dolomites at the Hotel Holzer. Hurrah! Well done!!

The hotel itself delivers everything one needs after the day in mountains. Rooms are large, well equipped and not too rustic. Food is excellent, wine list extensive, prices reasonable.

"“Very clean, very nice staff..”","We stayed here for a couple of nights to meet up with some friends. The rooms are very nice. Nice beds. The bathroom had a huge shower, two basins, with a rather odd strip of glass when if your kids are sharing a room they try and cover. The communal rooms of the hotel are excellent, again very clean. The spa is lovely. The pool is a really decent size, and very recently refurbed. Breakfast was perhaps the best we had all holiday..and if you like tea there are about 25 to choose from. The food was very good, if a little overwhelming. The staff are very friendly and helpful, beware the recommendation of an easy five hour walk however! Lots of walks and the scenery is stunning. Downsides. The sunbeds at the front are right on the road, which feels a little odd with people tramping by the other side of the very thin hedge. The room was very hot so we slept with window open. However, the cars are all parked at the front of the hotel so if someone's car alarm goes off, that can be irritating. Also there was some river party the first night with music til 1am, so not really the relaxing stay we had planned. I had tried to book direct with the hotel and never once got a response from the five emails I sent. In the end I booked with booking.com. They wouldn't put our tables together in the restaurant with the other family we knew. But overall very good, if a little pricey. Room Tip: ONe at the back of the hotel, away from the car park.

"“""""Modern Tranquility """"”","We stumbled upon this hotel as we were looking for a hiking base in the Dolomites. The stylish modern rooms displayed on their website enticed us to drive quite a bit farther than we intended and WOW were we pleased we did. Upon our arrival we were served prosecco and given quite a comprehensive explanation of the hotel's many services and amenities. Complimentary wine tastings, fitness classes and many other offerings. The room was fantastic, sleek and minimalist but warm and comfortable. The spa is AMAZING, different types of saunas, steam rooms and a meditation room, all state of the art. ( Be advised it is a co-ed spa and bathing suits are not permitted in some of the sauna rooms) The dinner was excellent , we had a fantastic locally raised rack of lamb. There is almost too much food as the salad/antipasti bar is generous, and followed by three other courses. Considering dinner and breakfast are included in the room rate, this represents a very good value. The hotel is quite casual and very family friendly. We were the only English speaking guests at the time of our stay and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.

“Leader in Pustertal”,"We have known Val Pusteria for over a decade and frquented several of its 4 stars hotels. We ha e this year found out about the renovated Hotel Monika at the center of the valley. A bright, stylish design done with taste and care, never pompous nor excessive. Everything is designed with the customer in mind. The swimming pool is a pleasure, the rooms exceptionallybgenerous in size and details. The top quality buffet and dinners are brought to a supersonic level by the efficient as well as friendly staff, lead by a great maitre de salle Ida.

As experienced travellers and tourism professionals we take our hats off to Hotel Monika. Our 2012 holidays are already booked.",family,POS
“Highly Recommended”,"We booked Hotel Monika for a getaway weekend (without the kids) and couldn't have been happier we did. We only had about 36 hours, but it felt like a true escape. When we first arrived, we were actually a little bit disappointed...mostly because we both imagined (for some reason) a hotel that was up on the mountain, surrounded by trees. The hotel is actually on the valley floor, and not as isolated as we had pictured it. Once we were inside our room, though, the disappointment faded very quickly. We could hear the sound of the rushing stream right under our balcony, and the views of the mountains are just breathtaking. We had a fabulous five-course meal included in the price of the room. A huge breakfast is also included, as are cakes in the afternoon. The amount of food contained in those three meals is PLENTY, so you don't even need to bother with lunch. One great thing about the hotel is its proximity to truly spectacular hiking. You can reach the Tre Cime in a couple of hours, and there is a WWI Open Air museum as well (we didn't have time for that but assume it is a one-day thing). We booked massages, which were very good and reasonably priced. The pool/sauna area is very nice...very high-grade materials throughout. The staff spoke English very well (we didn't need them to, but it was nice that they did!) and were VERY service oriented. I mentioned I would love to find a book in English, and they went running about trying to help me find one. Also, my husband asked for more eggs at the buffet and instead of just refilling it, they brought it to him personally. Small details like that really make or break a place, in my book. In general, the hotel was very detail-oriented...they leave you a nice white leather bag to carry your slippers and towels around in, with your room number on it so nobody picks up anyone else's... The one detail that could be considered a """"negative"""" was that the mattress was very hard. My husband woke up with a backache the first morning and kind of worked it off and forgot about it. But the second morning when he had it again, he actually got out of bed earlier than he wanted to because he was so uncomfortable because of it (which was a bummer since we were able to sleep in without the kids for the first time in four years!). We have a sort of """"high tech"""" mattress at home, so this could be the trouble but when he mentioned it downstairs they did say that he wasn't the first....SO, a little heads up if you are sensitive to that issue. Overall, though, it was really a fantastic experience. A beautiful part of South Tyrol and very high quality hotel.",couple,POS

The hotel has lovely rooms that are soundproof and comfortable. The beds can be made softer or harder like the pillows so sleeping is deep and long! There is no traffic noise - just the calm rush of water in the nearby river. The food is also excellent - the breakfast has everything you can imagine and service is fast ans furious!

And relaxing room with a breath taking view was just perfect! Be carefull - they switch off the saunas 1/2hour before the end, so if you go that time just be prepared it is not really hot... Food was excellent - huge selection, very tasty. We appreciated the ideas as a dessert buffet, soup buffet. We loved all we tried!

“A hidden gem”,"This hotel is like a dream come true. My friend and I stayed here a couple of weeks ago. A family member had recommended this hotel to us so we decided to check it out and we were SO glad we did. The hotel is family-run and the staff is beyond accommodating, kind and friendly. We got a room facing the mountains (highly recommend it if you choose to stay here!) which was absolutely breathtaking. The hotel itself is located in a charming little town in the countryside of Northern Italy right by the Dolomite mountains. The hotel is ideal for a romantic getaway or for a group who enjoys hiking the mountains during the day and relaxing by the spa in the hotel by night. The spa is equipped with a steam room, dry sauna, whirlpool, outdoor pool and so many more amenities. It is SO worth going to if you are looking to have a relaxing vacation. I will definitely be making a trip back in my lifetime -- this place is an A+ in my opinion! Room Tip: Mountain view room! See more room tips",family,POS
“Wonderful stay”,We stayed 4 nights and could have stayed much longer. The hotel is very quiet but very comfortable. We were the only English people in the hotel but were made very welcome. The staff all spoke a little English and the menu was translated and printed in English for us daily. The food was excellent and of a very high standard. The swimming pool was a little cold but the other wellness facilities were wonderful. We made good use of the hot tub and whirlpool. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. Ours had a spectacular view of the mountains and we were woken each morning to the sound of cow bells. Lots of places to visit and some excellent walks. A little pricey but well worth the expense.,couple,POS

“Don't Expect To See the Drei Zinnen From The Hotel!”,"Quaint old hotel that has the feel of being in a time warp. It must be hugely expensive to maintain but our impression was that it really needs quite a bit of work to bring up to modern standards. The decor was rather austere,carpets are very dull, bedroom doors open outwards and the windows are pretty old. This has a certain rustic charm and the bed was very comfortable. Noise does travel through the corridors quite noticeably but most guests are respectful and realise this so it was not a problem but it easily could be. The big disappointment for us was expecting to see the Drei Zinnen mountains - not sure why the hotel has the name as those famous peaks are about an hour's drive or a seriously long hike away. The view from the hotel is nevertheless very pretty and we were recommended a good hike by the receptionist from which we could get a distant view of the three peaks. The evening food is really excellent although there is no choice so you had better like the menu! Breakfast by the Alpine standards we have experienced elsewhere was disappointing and particularly in view of the evening meal - and the male waiters need to learn the art of smiling :-) . Wellness area quite modern but relax area is rather small considering - only 4 beds - not enough for size of hotel. Overall , for the price paid , we'd have to rate this average - perhaps its a 3.5 based on the evening meal but we have good Alpine comparisons and we'd have to say this place was not as good as those .

“Amazing!!”,"We have just returned from a week at the Hotel Monika. This is a fabulous hotel! The room was lovely (we stayed in Pinus), the food was out of this world and the service was exceptional including providing a translation of the menu every day for us to select our 5 course evening meal. The location is also fabulous with several cable cars etc to get you right up into the dolomites to start walks etc. It was a perfect week and we will be back!!!

“Lovely hotel in beautiful valley”,"This is a very attractive hotel with a slightly old-fashioned feel, which is all to the good in my opinion. The rooms are comfortable and vary in size, some being more like suites than mere bedrooms, and many having a mountain view - the mountains around this valley really are beautiful and the back of the hotel looks out over meadows to some of the most attractive of the peaks. The food in the restaurant is good, with a choice of main course and an extensive buffet to start with, and the service is really excellent. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the husband and wife couple who run the hotel make everyone feel very welcome. Be warned though that they only speak a little English, so German or Italian are useful - and the same goes for the rest of the village. The hotel is well situated down a quiet road in Moos and yet close to shops. It's only a short walk to a large playground and wooded area, and the other village in the valley, Sexten, is about 20 minutes' walk away. Although this is Italy, don't forget that this valley used to belong to Austria, and the native language is German. It still retains a Tyrolean feel and this is reinforced in the hotel when the lady of the house wears an attractive dirndl in the evenings - and the restaurant staff also do so on some nights.

We originally thought we would stay for 2 nights but extended our stay to 3 after we experienced the wonderful 5 course dinner in the delightful dining room. Although we were the only English speaking guests at the time we could not have been made more comfortable. The owner spoke good hospitality English, our evening menu was printed in English for us and the wait staff was helpful and charming. The food was really wonderful, especially the salad course (served as a buffet) and the appetizer course which was each night a highlight -- one night house-made ravioli, one night a ham and cheese strudl. Breakfast was excellent with the usual Austrian/Italian cereals, pastries meats, cheeses, as well as a fruit bowl One of the days they cooked eggs also.

"“A peaceful haven, and a wonderful base.”","We have been visiting this family run hotel for over 10 years now, and still find ourselves drawn back regularly. It is located in a quiet corner of a peaceful little village, with excellent access to the wonderful Sesto Dolomites which dominate the views. Parking at the hotel itself is quite limited, but there is a public parking area about 150m away. The standard of accommodation is very good, particularly in the annexe at the rear, which has recently been completely refurbished, and includes two very well appointed apartments. It is the food, however, which draws its regulars back for repeated visits. Dinner starts with an outstanding salad buffet, and it’s difficult to avoid the temptation to overload your plate. Main courses and puddings are imaginatively designed and beautifully executed. In the morning, an excellent breakfast buffet awaits you, and the chef will happily prepare a cooked breakfast course to order. All in all, a perfect choice for an activity holiday, or simply a relaxing break.",couple,POS
“Great hospitality in South Tyrol”,"We stayed for 7 nights at this smallish but stylish hotel overlooking Meran. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room (405) we occupied was very nice but maybe a bit dark but the view was absolutely fantastic. The bed was very comfortable. Housekeeping was above average. We would give minus points for the small bathroom and the quality of WiFi. We had dinner at the hotel every night of our stay, in a cosy Stube adjacent to the bar and the other two restaurants. We highly recommend to eat there, since you can order food from the other restaurants. We were impressed about the quality of the local food and the wines from the region. The service was outstanding and we were pleased with the food and wine recommendations. We did not try the SPA but there is an indoor swimming pool. The hotel building looks great inside and out, the only minor irritation was the lift which was very slow and not reliable. The reception desk gave us excellent advice on places to visit and things to do. One or more visits to Meran should be included in a visit to South Tyrol. It's a lovely city with good shopping. Adjacent Tyrol is a bit touristy but we recommend a meal at Culinaria, a top restaurant. What impressed us is the general friendliness of the people at the Miramonti and all the places we visited. Very likely we shall return to the Miramonti for another holiday.",couple,POS
“A very good family run hotel in Sesto”,"We stayed in the Mondschein a few years ago as we passed on the bus up to the Tre Cimine. We hopped off and it was great. This July, we booked for two nights as part of our annual Dolomiti holiday. It is still very good and comfortable being one of the oldest established hotels in the village. Like most Alpine hotels it is family run and very hospitable. The rooms are comfortable and sleep quality is good. Breakfasts are excellent, as are the evening dinners. The food is delicious and portions are generous. The Mondschein is recommended if you are in this part of the world. The half board prices are extremely reasonable.",couple,POS
"“Second choice, but perfectly happy”","Last summer, on a motorcycle trip, I had planned to stay at the top of the pass, but by the time I got there, the hotel was full, so I headed down the valley road, and when I saw the """"pizzeria"""" sign I pulled over. By that time (18:30) I wasn't going to be picky, so while 46 Euro for a single seemed a little steep, I took it. The room was clean and comfortable, and quiet, even though the hotel is on the main drag through town. I had planned to eat elsewhere, but ended up having a pizza and salad in the small outdoor seating area, where I watched the setting sun kiss the tops of the Dolomites, turning them first red, then orange, then pink. The pizza was excellent. The staff was courteous, and there is parking (open air) next to the hotel. I'd certainly stay there again",None,NEG
“A Great Hotel”,"We stayed at Miramonti for four nights and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. As they tell you, it is hard to find but hard to forget. We had a large, comfortable suite (room 403) with a picture-perfect view of St. Katherine's Church, a chapel completed in 1452, and the beautiful valley below. The hotel faces west which makes for some beautiful sunset views and it is easily accessible to some fabulous hiking routes in the mountains. The breakfast buffet included in the room rate was wonderful and we dined in the circular area of the dining room on two different nights. The food was excellent and the view is breath-taking. The only disappointment was the less than satisfying massages we had. We were hoping for a good, deep tissue massage after a day of hiking but found the gentleman lacking in that regard.

Breathtaking views and architectural design that maximises the enjoyment of the surroundings, was our first impression. The welcoming and competent desk staff made getting settled easy and comfortable. Impeccable taste in design combines a sense of beauty and comfort - modern style that doesn't compromise functionality. The staff was courteous and helpful but never intrusive, and answered our questions about the area and hiking patiently (and accurately!). The restaurants are wonderful, and we enjoyed all our breakfasts and evening meals there - we took the advice of previous visitors who said they didn't find anything better in the city. The chef prepared a wonderful variety of foods and the excellent servers recommended wines that complemented the dishes perfectly. Local produce, quality ingredients, beautiful presentation, and capable staff made dining there truly pleasurable. We stayed in the loft room and found it spacious, quiet, comfortable and beautiful - both in design and decoration, and the view of the mountains and the city below from the balcony completed our perfect stay.",couple,POS
"“Peace, Beauty and Quiet!”","I've been coming to this valley since the beginning of the seventies and in time it has preserved its calm, beauty and charm even though being close to a pretty big town like Bruneck. it is my third year in a row that I spend two weeks at the Schwartzenstein Hotel. The place is a haven for people seeking quiet and peace, who love hiking but also bathing in the beautiful pool (inside and outside are connected thru a sliding door)) or getting a massage or a sauna. The hotel is family run: it provides excellent service with a personal touch which usually lacks in anonymous chain hotels. Rooms are very clean, provided with all the amenities, bath robes included, plus a nice basket for the pool area with towels and slippers - The rooms are spacious, with terraces full of flowers (the most beautiful are the ones facing South). Common areas in the hotel are spacious and elegantly furnished with a nice bar open all day. There is a beautiful terrace overlooking the pool and the mountains where you can have lunch. They offer, as it is often the case in this area, 3/4 board which means a buffet breakfast, a buffet lunch and a four course dinner (choice of food) usually very good and varied. They have a dinner gala and local music once a week. People are really nice, helpful and provide group gymn, hiking tours, MT trails and Nordic walking during the week at no extra fee. An additional bonus is the Internet point (three computers) plus all the sitting area is connected wi-fi and everything is free! The atmosfere and dress code are relaxed although wearing bath robes is not accepted for lunch. All in all a great place to unwind, great for family with kids and couples alike: while girls take care of themselves in the Wellness area, boys can go hiking or MB and everybody is happy!!

“Family resort”,"After three visits in that hotel I decided to write a review. The location is on the border of Alto Adige and Veneto, under the famous 3 peaks and next to the forest. The view and the fresh air are fantastic. The breakfast buffet is with good choices. The dinner is a 5 course sophisticated menu, with free salad bar and it is a matter of taste. The hotel served as a base to trips in the Dolomites. The rooms are basic with a small TV, safe, small TV, no minibar or hot drink facilities. If you want internet, I recommend the 10 Euro for 24 hour deal. It means that only when you connected to the internet it counts. You can use it during 3 months. Don't forget to logout after every session. There is a problem with rooms with bathtub for older guests. The most confusing is the room numbering. You can find rooms with 1, 2, or 3 digits side by side, and to get to some of them you need detective skills. The pool nice and the decoration reminds me the paintings from Pompeii. There is a gym, Whirlpool, Sauna (no bathing suit) and beauty care. Just relax and enjoy",None,NEG
"“Stunning location, Stunning views but not a stunning hotel.”","Myself and my wife have just returned from a 4 night stay and the Kreuzbergpass Hotel in South Tyrol and i have some mixed emotions about out stay. The hotel is without doubt fantastic for skiing as it has its own piste and it has the most stunning views, which it commands from every angle. The hotel is a little dated, but the rooms are very large and very clean. However this does come at a price as we booked the most basic room, which didn't even come with any water, tea or coffee, english TV channels or any free internet in the rooms and we spent over 1,500 Euros for a short four night stay. The restaurant has a very good breakfast and the evening meal was of a very high class, except on the first night, where all dishes were stone cold. The spa area was outside the hotels main building and some people is brave it and leave there rooms in the dressing gown, and it was very, very nice but the only drawback was that the nice door swimming pool was ice cold. The staff at the hotel were on the whole, very nice and the head bar tender Magnus was very kind and recommended some fantastic award winning wine to us. The skiing instructed Hannas was brilliant and was a first class instructor. However, the owner of the hotel, Helga Aichner was not the best of hosts and in fact when we asked to use the internet at the main desk -(2 euro's for 1 hour), she basically walked away when she saw some friends and left us waiting whilst she was chatting for 10 minutes. The best part about our stay at this hotel was some of the very nice people we meet, and we are looking forward to travelling to German to meet Martina and Martina who were fantastic. I wouldn't come back and stay at this hotel again as it was a little soulless and very expensive as what you really paid for was the location. Andy and Terri Grant, Norwich, England",couple,NEG
“Could the Stan Darsh South Park episode have been based on this hotel?”,"Hm. I have mixed feelings about this hotel, so I will begin with its pros: * The location and pistes are very good for quality skiing. * The food was quite nice. * The rooms are very clean. * The spa area is very nice and the facial I had was very good quality. *The chimney room is warm and welcoming. * the views are stunning. The cons: * All courses of the five course meal were cold on the first night we arrived. * the swimming pool is very cold indeed. * there is no water provided in the room nor tea and coffee. * the internet costs extra and there is no general computers available for guests to use, which given that the hotel attracts a lot of business people, i feel this is not acceptable. The wifi is only available in the reception area, not in the rooms. In this day and age i expect more. * i could have overlooked these cons, but the narcissistic, frosty and unprofessional attitude of the owner REALLY annoyed me, particularly when we paid a lot of money to stay here. Not impressed at all and I would never return. * lots of the other guests were also of this ilk- very concerned with image but underneath this, there is not much of substance.",couple,NEG

“A gem of a hotel in the Sud Tirol”,"We spent a very pleasant week at this very comfortable hotel. It is set in a beautiful environment-the wonderful displays of window box flowers in the village gladden the heart, We were on a walking holiday and had less than a 100m to the bus stop that connected to the lifts up to the mountains. The rooms were large, comfortable and clean.The facilities were excellent-swimming pool, sauna area, gym and a large spa complex. The highlight for me was the food. A sumptuous breakfast buffet that satisfied all diets from the most healthy to the most ill advised. The dinner options too provided a low calorie option or the five course-or as many courses as you chose- set menu that was beautifully cooked. There were also a la carte options but the menu provided excellent variety. The wines were almost exclusively Italian-a huge range-and reasonably priced. The staff, dressed in Tirolean style, were unfailingly pleasant and professional. The front desk could not have been more helpful. Despite being in Italy, this area and hotel are firmly in the Germanic Alpine tradition. I suspect that I was the only Brit staying there albeit with Swiss family. The majority of the guests were predominantly German with a good Swiss representation. They proved to be most relaxed of companions. Excellent value for money given the quality of the services provided.",couple,POS
“Paradise!!!”,"Stay there on night in Dec 11. One word beforehand: a heavenly experience!!! We loved every bit and second of this experience. Excellent personal reception, state-of-the art garage next door, tastefully appointed spacious room with great view, the best dinner I ever had, the best wine (also in terms of value for money) and all of that coupled with a service level and attention to detail that cannot be topped by any property I know and there are a few houndreds I do know. Their SPA building is an oasis of tranquility and relaxation. It can easily compete with some of the worlds leading Spas and Hotel wellness places. The breakfast was a dream - huge selection and everything fresh and local products. Even the owner shakes hands and wishes a nice day. That place - in all aspects I can think of - exceeded our expectations by far! Another thing I liked is that despite the high quality of everything, there are no """"would-like-to-be-important"""" people there. No nervous individuals sitting in the lobby bar sipping on champagne with one hand and typing emails on their BlackBerry with the other hand. None of all of that which makes it even better. Way better. Probably thanks to the remote location away from airports and business districts so the """"wanna-be VIPs"""" cannot even find it.

“Loved It!”,"I am almost hesitant to write a review of this place. Schenna is not on the American tourist radar and I sort of don't want anyone to find out about it! Seriously, I was the only American at this hotel for the week I was there and I think I was the only American in the whole town! So, if this would intimidate you, then you probably wouldn't like it, but I loved it. Hotel Hohenwart is a series of 3 buildings with an array of amenities. They have a full fitness center (but I never saw anyone use it -- why would you exercise indoors when you have the beautiful Alps to wander in?) They have an indoor and outdoor pool, saunas, several quiet rooms and then the spa -- ahhh. The Vista Spa is a very nice facility with a variety of different rooms -- steam sauna, dry sauna, quiet rooms and then they have this rooftop pool/spa that has these amazing views toward Schenna castle, the mountains, etc. It was wonderful. One reviewer complained that the dinner meals were small and they were - but the dinner was a 5 course event! A huge salad bar with different kinds of breads, a soup, an appetizer (like an onion tart), your main dish, a cheese course and then desert! If you had large portions through all of this you would be stuffed! I thought it was the perfect amount of food and it was all prepared and presented beautifully. The chocolate croissants at breakfast were to die for. Everyone at the hotel was very nice -- from the front desk to the maid who cleaned my room (I especially liked Angela at the front desk -- I think that was her name!). Every day at breakfast they provide an activity list for the day -- so there is a daily guided hike, some sort of demonstration, i.e, wine tasting or introduction to herbs for cooking, etc. There are miles and miles of hiking trails in the area and an amazing cycling tour in the Vinschgau valley. Merano is a short 10 minute bus ride away, so if you want to shop, etc., it's nearby. My room in the Christine building was a little dated, but I also thought that building had the best views, so I was fine with that.

“Wonderful mountain retreat”,"A stylish hotel set in an unforgettable mountain location overlooking Merano, this is one of the best hotels we have been to in terms of ambience and service. The rooms are spacious and have balconies that look down onto Merano. They are clean and uncluttered and this adds to the relaxing feel. The city is clearly visible but there was little noise in the hotel. Room service came twice each day and every evening there was a newsletter detailing suggested activites for the following morning. We hired some of the e-bikes (helpful on the mountains around Hafling) and went on the picturesque walks around the area. Winetasting was by the affable and knowledgable owner Klaus. Dining there was a delight and we were impressed with the quality of the food in the restaurant on the set evening menu. This was important since driving into Merano was not an option as we wanted to enjoy some wine with dinner. Afternoon tea was served daily on the terrace and this was pleasant treat to come back to after a day out or a decadent way to end an session in the tranquil spa.",couple,POS
“The Best Experience Imaginable!”,"Well, what can we say? We honestly feel that the Miramonti hotel was the greatest hotel we have experienced. It not due to opulence, rather just pure comfort, beauty, service, and style. We shall return and we have never visited the same hotel as our philosophy has always been stay at different places for different experiences. Everyone was charming and the views were impeccable.

“Another day for you and me in paradise!”,"Do you remember these words from the very popular (long time ago) song by Phil Collins: «…its another day for you and me in paradise!»? I can continue: in paradise – in «Miramonti»! Because I am sure – hotel-boutique «Miramonti» is paradise. Me and my husband found it 3 years ago, when we visited Merano for the first time. Then we stayed down in valley, in one of numerous Merano’s hotel. And once, late in the evening we saw a group of bright lights high above - somewhere between earth and heaven. We asked a manager of our hotel what is this. And he told us that it may be a hotel in the mountains. Later, when we went back home, I found the information about hotel-boutique «Miramonti» on booking.com and tripadvisor.com. I realized that this is a hotel of my dream and I want to visit it for sure! And finally my dream became a true! We spent in «Miramonti» two wonderfull days, celebrating the 25-th anniversary of our wedding. Only two days – of course, it is not too long. But we did many things: we had absolutely fantastic dinner in the panoramic restaurant, we did walking tour on wild forest passes, we enjoyed SPA-facilities (I liked steam-sauna best of all and coffee in the morning near swimming pool), we tasted local wines in a bar, we relished adorable views from our balcony and so on, so on… I appreciate attention of the hosts Klaus and Carmen – they work in the hotel themselves. And did it with love! I think, this is the explanation of the «Miramonti» success. We made a long trip from Siberia (Russia) to Avelengo. And were not disapointed at all. I hope, our next visit to «Miramonti» will be longer than 2 days! I am dreaming about it right now! Room Tip: All rooms are very nice and comfortoble and have a great view!

The staff is very friendly and nice, all of them - from reception ladies to restaurant and cleaninfg staff. We really enjoyed hotel's restaurants, which serve light and elegant dishes mostly from italian cuisine. And prices were surprisingly fair for such quality of food, service and the whole setting. We don't usually have diners in hotels, but in Miramonti we had diners 2 nights out of 5. Breakfast was very good as well, a lot of healthy options. I cannot leave out nice touches of the hotel: welcome glass of prosecco on the terrace and good-bye bottles of water for the journey back home. We enjoyed nicely organised spa-zone with a pool, saunas and outdoor terrace with lounge chairs. There is also a small room with some excersise machines. The room is simple, but spacious and comfortable. Cleaning is impeccable, 2 times a day. And there were nice touches too: complimentary apples, sweets in the evening, notes with surroundings info. The only thing I didn't like was semi-transparent bathroom door: lying on the bed you can see a person on the lavatory pan.

We spent a few days this Summer to escape the heat and found excellent service, lots of very good food and a very relaxing Sauna & Steam Bath area. Even when the sun was out the weather was pleasantly cool. Lots of opportunities for mountain walks, from very easy to quite difficult, to enjoy the beautiful scenaries of the SudTyrol Alps. Returning to the hotel, they have a very good SpA for massages and other treatments. The rooms are wide and properly furnished, and the place is very quiet (hardly hear the noise of a motorcar). Very nice for famlies with young children but also for couples willing to take a relaxing break. Easy to reach from Vipiteno, I would highly reccomend it to travellers who want to enjoy an unspoilt and beautiful Alpine valley, still not yet overcrowded with tourists, and a simple but very friendly service and lots of very good food.

“A very relaxing vacation”,"We have been at Alphotel Tyrol for the fourth time by now, although we usually change location every year. But our children love it so much that we just could not come again;-) The hotel offers really amazing stuff for children, a huge playground, a beautiful garden with lots of space, animals were the eye can see, pony-riding and a gorgeous swimming pool. The food is amazing, and especially suited for families, since one can choose whatever one likes among dozens of plates. We participate every year in some of the hiking tours and always like it, which is not difficult as the hotel is in the middle of the Alps. The spa treatments are perfect and the staff very well trained. The hotel stuff in general was very nice, always smiling and helpful.

“Top Notch!”,"We loved our stay at the Grones. It was a perfect base for our day hiking excursions on the Alpe de Siusi, Seceda, and Rasciesa trails -- all were accessible from lifts about a 10-minute walk from the inn starting along the lovely Luis Trenker Promenade. The half-board option (breakfast plus dinner) was superb and very reasonably priced, especially given the outstanding quality of the food (only 15 euros per person more than the standard bed and breakfast rate). Each night, the inn's award-winning chef offered an inventive (and different) four- or five-course menu. As """"pescatarians,"""" we were especially pleased that we could choose either fish or vegetarian courses. Every meal was delicious and beautifully presented. One night before dinner (it's usually on Friday nights, but during our stay, it was held on a Thursday night to accommodate the schedules of several guests), the inn hosted a local accordion player decked out in traditional Tyrolean regalia. He serenaded us with his beautiful voice and playing as we sampled a variety of hors d'oeuvres and prosecco outside the dining room. During dinner, he roamed from table to table, singing in German, Italian, or English. All of the wait staff wore traditional Tyrolean outfits that night as well. Our room was spacious, spotlessly clean, and furnished in a comfortably updated Tyrolean style, with ample storage space for clothes and other belongings. The bath and (one-person) shower were also fully modernized and in beautiful condition. Finally, the staff at the Grones were first-rate. In fact, we've rarely stayed at an inn or a hotel where there was such an obvious sense of teamwork among the staff. Most were multi-lingual, and most seemed to share a true commitment to """"customer service."""" Monika at the front desk was incredibly helpful throughout our stay, with great suggestions for hiking and other outings. In hindsight, we were delighted that we chose to stay at the Grones -- though it's outside the center of Ortisei, it's still very close to all of the shops and restaurants """"downtown"""" and to all of the lifts in town. If we're ever back in the area, we would definitely -- and happily -- stay at the Grones again!",family,POS
“Absolutely the BEST hotel and location in the Dolomites!!”,"This family run hotel is filled with excellent staff, friendly waiters and top rated five course dinners (I agree with others that this would equal many Michelin-rated restaurants). Halfboard (which includes breakfast and the five course dinner) was definitely the way to go! Each individual course was fantastic. If you do not have a creative palate, the staff is more than accommodating, and will make a delicious spaghetti bolognese, or whatever you prefer. The location is perfect, walking distance to many of the sites (town, ski lifts to the extensive network of hiking and mountain bike trails and the S. Giacomo church). It was the best and most lively town to visit in the Val Gardena area, with many shopping opportunities. We took our 19 month old son who absolutely adored the staff and location (lots of excellent playgrounds less than a block away, and he loved hiking). He was only able to sit at the dining table for about an hour (before wanting to get up and explore), and if I was not finished with my meal, the waiters would bring any remaining courses to our room so I could let him play in the room (or sleep) and would finish the courses in the comfort of our room. This was the best hotel I have ever visited, with superior staff and facilities. I would recommend this hotel to anyone (solo, friends, family, business and couples) who were looking for a relaxing, beautiful hotel with top rated food, wines, scenery, and excellent and helpful staff.

The hotel, food and staff are all as delightful as they were on our last visit.

There is nothing she has not done and so her advice should be taken to maximise your experience.

“Joyful stay for family of 5 in the summer”,"The thing that comes out as you call them for reservation is the staff's friendliness. Most of them are fluent in English and of course all the local languages. They will do anything to make your stay joyful. This is family run hotel, but everything is completely professional like the most luxurious chain hotels. We booked the place months in advance. We secured two garden rooms with connecting doors. The view from the room is just stunning. It is great landscape of green mountains. It is extremely relaxing. The rooms are modern and nicely decorated. There is wide door going out to the garden. The beds are very comfortable. The bathroom is spacious and functional, but very minimalistic. There is heated indoor pool that is great for fun. The pool's garden benefits from the surrounding beautiful landscapes. The hotel deal is half board. Surprisingly, this is genuine gourmet restaurant with new menu every day. The will help you make your choices and will also make special effort to cook whatever your kids like. Our kids loved the place and the restaurant. The location is also great. It is good starting point for many local attractions and also relatively short drive from more attractions like Passo Sella. If there is one thing I would improve is addition of air-condition in the rooms. In this area they we could not find one hotel with air-condition. The nights are indeed cold, but if you what to close the shutters and sleep late with no early day late, the room will be too hot... at least for me. I guess it is too much to ask in a place that is covered with snow 4-5 months a year. It has been great stay for the entire family. Now we are waiting for opportunity to enjoy the place without the kids. Room Tip: The garden rooms are really nice. I would choose it again. See more room tips",family,POS
“Fairytale”,"We visited the hotel during summer. It's clean and spacious, and staff is very friendly. Well located as starting point of walks. Breakfast and dinner are very good. Only downside is that you could get a table appointed (for the time of you stay) in a somewhat separate room without any windows. Not very nice to have every day your breakfast and dinner in a completely enclosed room. After a few times we asked for, and got, another table in the main room. Spa very enjoyable.

“What a find!!!”,"We had the good luck to book and spend a week in this delightful hotel. It is difficult to find something to say that has not been said before by loads of other guests, but here we go: First the hotel is fantastic, very clean and with a very warm atmosphere. The attention to details is second to none. Oskar and Sonja are impeccable hosts and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast’s buffet has been one of the best, in choice and quality, that we ever had and trust me, we have been all around the world, from a tent at 5000 meters -15C to a five star hotel in the middle of the jungle +35C. Dinner was also very good and should deserve at least a Michelin star. The herb risotto was one of the best we have ever tasted and the “guanciale di maialino” was fingers licking good. Now the spa: due to the very unseasonal weather we had at the end of May, we were unable to enjoy the outdoor as planned, but at least we had the pleasure in sampling the Wellness Centre: 2 steam rooms, 2 saunas, a cold room, an infrared room, Jacuzzi and to cap it all an excellent rest room to cool down, all very well decorated and well maintained. All in all a place that I would strongly recommend to all my friends as well as acquaintances at my golf club. Diego and Jenny Room Tip: Just get there!! See more room tips",couple,POS
“Great place to spend a wintervacation”,"As we made the reservation quite late, not all types of rooms were still available. But M. Oskar Oberhofer, the manager,took the effort of measuring the bathroom and the doors to make sure the wheelchair could get through.We got a nice, spacious room, with an accessible and sunny balcony, the Manager had a small wooden ramp made so I could enjoy the sun there until 14h30 pm. In the morning a large and varied breakfast buffet was served and an excellent 5- course supper in the evening. We rarely ate this well in a hotel.The cableway to the skislopes is 300m uphill Unfortunately we did not try the wellness center but it looked very nice.

“Such a lovely hotel”,"We stayed here in March with another couple (in our 20's) and had a fantastic time. Everyone at the hotel is so wonderfully friendly. Its great value and the food is all delicious - and so much of it! We arrived late on the first night as our bus had to go the long route round (the pass was closed due to snow) and they kindly kept our supper warm and waited until we arrived. After a couple of nights they remembered our drinks orders. When the lady at reception saw me looking at the weather report in French and German she, without being asked, arranged for it to be translated into English for the next day. Its the little things like that that make such a difference. The room was perfect size, it was what I expected for the price. A great little balcony with nice views and lots of storage, comfy bed etc. The spa is great after a long day skiing, it might seem weird at first but I would definitely recommend sitting around the edge in the loungers provided with a cup of tea, super relaxing. The location is great, you can ski back to the door and its only a short walk in the morning (max 10 mins). If you ski the Sella Ronda I would really advise you get first lift as its very busy later on - that way you'll have the slopes to yourself for at least an hour or two. Later in the day the Sella Ronda is really too busy so I'd suggest skiing elsewhere - Corvara and the surrounding area has loads to choose from. The food in all the restaurants is also really good, especially if you stick to the more italian ones. If you're looking for night life, this is not the place for you. We went out to the bars for a couple nights but it was pretty much just us in there. It's ideal for a chilled family holiday, couples holiday or just with a load of mates who are happy to make their own entertainment.

There is no need to worry about getting to the ski lifts as the hotel has a wonderful shuttle service that drops you to the lifts in Ortisei. When you have finished skiing you just call the hotel and they send the bus to pick you up. Perfect!! We have been to the Dolomites several times and this hotel and resort are by far the best.

“Our stay at the Hotel Grones in Ortesei/ St Ulrich was a highlight of our three week trip.”,"In part thanks to previous Trip Advisor reviews, I selected the Hotel Grones for a one week stay. The newly built, family run hotel is extremely nice with excellent, spacious rooms with many up to date conveniences. A number of the rooms have terrraces with views over the town and Sassolungo in the distance. Ortesei/St Ulrich is in a beautiful location in the Val Gardena and makes an excellent base for hiking. The hotel is not inexpensive but appears to be competitively priced with other comparable four star hotels in the area. The management and the staff of the hotel were extremely efficient , very friendly and very helpful with every request that we had ranging from recommendations for good hikes to quickly finding a local doctor when one was needed for our son. We booked the hotel on a bed and breakfast basis only because of previous bad experiences with meals when we booked on a half board basis. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, the food at Hotel Grones is excellent. After trying the hotel dining room on our first night at the invitation of the manager, we ate all of our dinners for the week there due to the extremely high quality of the food. The food was an outstanding value- among the best we have found in many trips to Europe. The menu was a good mix of local specialties from the area with some more typical Italian dishes. There was also a good, well priced wine list with many local wines among the choices. We highly recommend Hotel Grones and hope to return there someday. When we do, we hope that the experience will be every bit as enjoyable.",family,POS
“Perfect in every way.”,"As soon as I found this hotel on Trip Advisor and checked out the hotel’s website I knew it was the ideal hotel for us. After spending the previous week at Malcesine on Lake Garda, we travelled up to Ortisei and stayed 4 nights at the Hotel Grones to complete our lakes & mountains holiday in Italy. We were greeted warmly by Wilfried Grones and shown to our lovely spacious room on the 3rd floor, with beautiful views to the West from the flower decked balcony. Everything about this family run hotel is excellent. An English version of the dinner menu was on our breakfast table each morning for us to choose which starter & main course we would like. The food is beautifully presented and tastes delicious. All the staff are very friendly and helpful and go out of their way to make sure everything is perfect. Our hire car remained in the hotel garage for the whole of our stay, because we purchased a 3day Valgardena Card for 55Euros (a 6day card is available for 69 Euros) which gives unlimited and free use of all the cable cars and chair lifts in Val Gardena that are open in the summer, as well as free travel on the local buses. We thought this was the perfect way to see the local area and was good value for money. We enjoyed a lovely 4 days in Ortisei and even had perfect weather. We had never visited this area of Italy before, but fell in love with it and look forward to returning soon for a longer stay.",couple,POS
“Hotel Grones: Amazing!”,"Hotel Grones… What a wonderful, beautiful, amazing place to stay! The food was absolutely exquisite. We had Tyrolean appetizers and live accordion music before our Friday night meal and a Gala dinner Saturday. Our teenage daughter thought they served the best food she had ever tasted. The location, unparalleled. The spa – 3 different saunas, all different temperatures and styles, complete with aromatherapy, candles and fresh lemonade. The staff—the most helpful, professional, and attentive we encountered in our 5 weeks in Europe, and previous trips as well. Just so you know this is a legit review, my wife offers a critique (it took work to get it out of her!): They gave lovely shampoo, but no conditioner. Teens need to be 16 to use the sauna and clothes are forbidden. Although the sign requests this, people wore clothes if they wanted to. The Jacuzzi is on the coolish by North American standards. We intend to return to Grones for a week in a few years. It was a most special experience.",family,POS

It would be more accurate to say the food exceeded our expectations while the room, location, pool, cleanliness etc. met them very well. The food was out of this world! They even had a reception for guests on Friday niight with appetizers and a tyrolean accordionist who was great. Only three things that could have been better - they pour very weak drinks, you were almost better off with the mini-bar or sticking to wine/beer.. There's no fitness center. Also the location was quite a hike from the bus station with bags. It wasn't the distance so much as the steep steps.

“Little slice of heaven”,"We spent three weeks in Italy (traveling with kids 16, 14 and 10) and this was my favorite spot. The hotel was immaculate, food was fantastic. Stayed three nights and never once wanted to try another spot for dinner. A quiet and quaint respite that served as a """"breather"""" after a week of crowded, touristy, hot sightseeing in Rome and Venice. The scenery is beautiful, took two cable cars and just enjoyed the views. There is lots of hiking for those who enjoy it. The small town of Ortisei has a pedestrian area and is very quaint. The owners don't speak a lot of English, but we could communicate effectively enough. Hotel Grones and Ortisei are a little off the beaten track when touring Italy, but if I were going to go back, this would be the first place I would return.",family,POS
“A wonderful experience”,"As all the others reviews have said, the Hotel Grones is wonderful. I note that the last reviewer said that the room was small - ours (a superior room) was huge. Kingsize bed, plenty of wardrobe space, large bathroom with walk-in shower (which we asked for - not being bath people), balcony etc . Spotlessly clean. The food is exceptional. They take your dinner order at breckfast (there's a choice of three things for starter, main course and dessert - on top of which there's generally another two little courses too). I was tempted to try things I hardly ever (if ever) have at home - veal, rabbit, beef carpaccio. The menu includes a wine recommendation from the lower end of the price range - we went with that each night, as it introduced us to Tyrolean wines, and it was all excellent. Breakfast included a really good range of fruit, ceral, meats, cheeses and breads (we had breakfast, hiked all day without lunch and then had dinner - if we'd have had lunch we wouldn't have been able to appreciate the delights of dinner!). The owners and staff were all very friendly, for us they had the right balance between efficiency, helpfulness and informality. For those with a car, there's a large underground garage (we drove from Innsbruck, which was an easy drive of under 2 hours). It's an nice 10-15 minute stroll into the town along a pedestrianized walkway just to the front of the hotel. It's really good for an after dinner stroll! The hiking / scenery are wonderful - we tended to hike up mountains and get the gondola / cable car etc down, which gave the lungs a good workout! I'd recommend the hotel to anyone and REALLY hope to go back some time soon! Room Tip: We had 205, which was great, but I think they're probably all good See more room tips",couple,POS
“Highly recommended”,"This is almost a boutique hotel ... even if the rooms are a bit small it includes a cute cozy spa and a great gourmet kitchen with the simplicity of a family business (it's the first time I see a gourmet restaurant where I can ask a second plate, and believe me that feels very nice!). The menu changes everyday and seems it does not repeat (at least not in two weeks). The assortment of wines is also very good. The location is just perfect, near the town services (walking distance) but far from the noise of the road and just a few minutes from major hiking trails and you can have a nice view from all rooms (they all have balconies facing south towards the valley) I would recommend this hotel to couples, but keep in mind depending on the season you may have some children around. I observed the management took care of allocating the families with children to one side of the restaurant floor, while the couples were seated on the other half. Overall it is a place we would gladly go back some day! Room Tip: All rooms have balcony facing south with view of the valley ... if you go in winter I suggest the ro...

“Fantastic hotel!”,"We were at the Hotel Grones for four nights in July 2012 and enjoyed every minute of our stay! Not only is the property beautiful, it is the cleanest, neatest hotel I think I've every been to. The comments about the family Grones and other staff lived up to our expectations as each query or encounter was extremely helpful and friendly. I loved our the owners came around to greet the guests at dinner each night. We stayed with the half board option and we truly impressed with the gourmet dinners each evening! Each and every dinner brought rave reviews from us and we are particular about preparation and quality of food. My husband and I are still craving the homemade pastas and delightful treats we enjoyed. Although wine is generally not included in the dinner, one night there was a complimentary glass of prosecco. On another evening we enjoyed a fabulous dessert buffet with a complimentary glass of dessert wine. We did find the hotel mattress to be a bit too firm for our American tastes. Although we didn't ask for a mattress pad to cushion, I have no doubt that the staff would find a way to make any wish come true, including softening one's bed. If you go to the Val Gardena, you will not be disappointed in this hotel. It truly is as superior as all the other reviews attest!",couple,POS
“Perfect family run hotel”,"We stayed for 1 week in June/July. The unobtrusive attention to detail by the family ensures that your holiday will be relaxing and enjoyable. Family and staff all showed an interest in their guests and were all trying to ensure they enjoyed their stay. The hotel is located just above the village so is quiet, but does require an uphill journey at the end of the day. We had a Superior room which was large, nicely furnished, with a balcony looking across the valley. The food was excellent and included special meals during the week. Service was friendly and at a nice pace. The swimming pool area was a good place to relax after a day's walking. Thanks to everyone and we would definitely recommend this hotel.

“A Magic Kingdom”,"The Grones family hotel deserves every word of praise written about it. Husband, wife, delightful daughter Nadia, and her talented husband Roman run the BEST small hotel we have ever encountered. We recently spent 3 nights in a beautiful room with balcony overlooking the Italian Alps and the green valley below. It is better than any picture postcard. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and more than comfortably equipped. You might think you were the first guests in these quarters. Everything there is top quality and works perfectly. I feel like thanking the Grones family for letting us stay with them in their magic kingdom. They are perfect hosts who invite you to enjoy their little piece of paradise.

"“Wonderful, relaxing hotel.”","Wow! This family really know how to run an excellent hotel and keep their customers happy. We have just spent 3 night at Hotel Grones. The atmosphere is wonderful; small, friendly and relaxing, yet everything is organised to perfection. We had a Superior room which was large, comfortable and immaculate, with a south facing balcony and beautiful views over the Val Gardena. The half board is fantastic value for money, as they have a talented chef producing varied and tasty evening meals. The desserts and homemade breakfast pastries were to die for, so arrange some hiking and biking to burn off calories; the hotel has good bikes to use. The Pool and Spa area have been decorated to create a wonderful, relaxing ambience. The bar/reception area is very comfortable and tasteful. Lovely in the sunshine, but there is a fireplace which would be cosy in the Winter months too. Fantastic staff. Highly Recommended.",couple,POS

“Superlative all-round experience”,"Having failed to find any accommodation whatsoever in our preferred skiing base of Selva or Santa Cristina, we hesitantly accepted an offer from the Grones for a mid-week ski trip. We arrived early on Thursday morning and although our room was still occupied, we were offered changing facilities and complimentary breakfast to enable us to prepare for a complete day's skiing with a full stomach and refreshed from the drive to the resort. Although the hotel's location makes a walk to the ski lifts or nearest bus stop uncomfortable in full ski gear, the hotel offer an """"on demand"""" shuttle service which removed any pain from the lift connection. We returned tired and hungry after a full day on the slopes (confirmed at 49km distance and 9000 metres vertical by the excellent Dolomiti internet ski pass tracker) to be collected from Ortisei by the hotel. Our room (209) was excellent - spacious, modern, clean and comfortable. We just had time before dinner to don our inclusive bathrobes and towel selection for an exploratory visit to the """"wellness centre"""", comprising pool, Jacuzzi and a variety of steam/sauna facilities as well as relaxing lounger areas. Dinner was a superb balance between pretentiousness and plain simplicity - instead offering a selection of creative, tasty and wholesome dishes at each of its 4 courses. The wine selection was modest but perfectly adequate and reasonably priced. This pattern continued throughout our (regrettably) brief stay, with all staff going out of their way at every opportunity to be helpful, welcoming and genuinely keen to ensure that our experience was as relaxed and enjoyable as possible. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any traveller who appreciates great service, fine food and a luxury experience at a very competitive price. And for keen skiers, don't let Ortisei's relative remoteness from the main """"Sella Ronda"""" circus put you off - the extra distance from Selva adds a new dimension to the skiing opportunities and the reasonably priced """"Ski express"""" bus service along the Gardena valley is always available if tired legs prevent you skiing all the way home, or an expedition to distant Marmolada or Falzarego are on the day's agenda.",friends,POS

“Gorgeous!”,"Hotel Grones was a small boutique hotel with gorgeous rooms and views of the valley, an indoor swimming pool, outdoor lounge chairs, and fantastic dining. Our spacious room was contemporary with an extremely comfortable bed with down comforters and pillows and a small terrace. Its location was ideal for exploring the exquisite Dolomites. Ortisei was picture postcard perfect, with nearby cable car rides to the top of the surrounding peaks. The staff was helpful and provided maps and instructions to all the sites.

"“Great hotel, great staff”","I spent 6 days at Grones in Jan 2011. The hotel is brand new, the superior room we had was definetely large by Valgardena standard. The hotel staff is top quality, we have a 6 months old daughter and they have been really helpful with us and genuinely nice to her. We appreciated the half board, dinners were very pleasant. The relax area, especially sauna&steam room, is very well conceived and definitely a major plus. On the contrary the swimming pool is not big enough to swim. To tell the truth, the hotel is among the most expensive on its category. My minor suggestions for a few amendaments. Frankly, breakfast buffet should be improved (chemical orange juice jug is not what you expect in a 4 star hotel). Wi-fi should be offered for free. At lunch time the restaurant is off, the bar could offer a minimalist menu. I would also suggest the managers to arrange a body treatment room to offer massages on site; a fitness room could also be created somewhere. That said, the hotel fully deserves its 4 stars. I would recommend this hotel to everybody. Looking fwd to staying again soon.",family,NEG
“Can't Wait to Go Back”,"As every other reviewer has stated, this place is as close to perfect as possible. The Grones family who owns and operates the hotel all take a personal hand in management and hospitality; it must be in the genes, because they all strive to make the visit pleasurable for all. Take advantage of the 1/2 board and enjoy vast breakfast spreads and very high quality cuisine for dinner. The chef happens to be married to the Grones daughter, so the family has extended it control over all aspects of the hotel. There is a wonderful spa in the downstairs area with several different types of saunas. These are of the highest quality, but are nudist only. It is still worth it to experience these world class saunas. I could go on and on, but it would all be positive and highly complimentary of the Grones family, its staff and the top drawer accommodations. We intend to return as soon as possible.",couple,POS
“Excellent family-run hotel”,"Only an ardent skier, looking to roll out of his bed directly onto the piste, would be hesitant about staying at the Hotel Grones. Our stay - a family party of six, including two 10yr-old boys - was one of the best we have all had. The hotel was spotless and modern, but with a traditional feel, and the staff were most helpful, friendly and attentive in the way found only in a family-owned and run hotel. The food was consistently excellent, and the wine cellar well stocked, especially with local wines, which were superb if sometimes a little pricey. The facilities for those of us not on the pistes all day were also excellent - a large pool, jacuzzi, solarium and the most impressive sauna complex. My wife celebrated her birthday while we were there, and the management and staff all helped make her day a wonderful occasion. All in all it was a wonderful week, and I can't recommend this hotel enough for either winter or summer holidays.",family,POS
“Outstanding”,"Difficult one this. Part of me wants to keep this family-run hotel a well-kept secret; but it is difficult not to give rave reviews. We spent a week here and were blown away by the efficiency and warmth of the hospitality. The food is sublime. The place is spotless. The staff were just great and made the kids really welcome. The atmosphere among the other guests was terrific. Don't miss the sauna facilities downstairs: there are three saunas (Turkish, Finnish and bio); just the thing you need after a hard day's skiing. For ardent skiiers who like to be closer to the slopes, you may want to be further up the valley, closer to the Sella; but for us at least, this was absolutely perfect, since we had good access to the cross-country skiing slopes and if you can easily acces the main domain via Seceda (but get up early to miss the crush at Furnes during the holiday period).

“Fantastic.”,"Upon arrival we asked reception where we could rent ski equipment, and they immediately insisted on taking us to their own supplier in town, leaving us in the piazza near the supplier who was super helpful, quick, and professional, and even brought our ski equipment to the hotel for us. Then, the hotel picked us up again in the piazza when we called them, after we had had a chance to walk around town and enjoy this charming village. The breakfasts with made-to-order eggs, full buffet bar, freshly squeezed orange juice, etc. was enough to keep us going until afternoon. Each morning they drove us directly to the ski lifts, we were even able to buy the ski passes directly from reception. The junior suite is a large comfortable room with a beautiful balcony opening up to the hillside, a walk-in type of closet, a big bathroom. Very clean. An afternoon snack is provided for when they pick you up again from the slopes in the large foyer where you can enjoy the snowfall from inside the floor to ceiling windows. .....and the dinner??!? Choice of 2 starters, 2 first dishes, 2 main courses, and dessert, with a beautiful salad bar and even healthy choices, if one desires. The service is impeccable, from the waiters to the manager/owner who moves from table to table chatting with the guests, without being too intrusive. The spa is fabulous. The hot stone massage: worth every penny. The sauna and steam rooms are wonderful. The jacuzzi could be a bit hotter, but that would be the only less-than-amazing element of this otherwise perfect vacation experience. This was our first visit to Ortisei, and we are already planning on returning this winter.

"“Great family-run hotel conveniently located in Ortisei (Val Gardena), the gateway to the Dolomites!”","Our family of 4 (2 adult children) stayed here for a special Christmas week package.

There were great views from every room, as the location was on a hillside about a kilometer outside of the city center. Best of all was the staff, which catered to every need. This hotel is run by the Kelder family, who were always working to make sure everything went well. For us this was a ski week, and we had immediate door to door service to either of the Ortisei lifts (Seceda which is the more difficult area and the way to the famous """"Sella Ronda,"""" and Siusi de Alpes which is a larger but much more intermediate part of the ski area with only blues and reds). The shuttle van would be available to drop us or pick us up within minutes, at any time. Breakfasts included traditional continental fare, but also a full breakfast cooked to order if you wanted it. Afternoons after skiing a small buffet was available to tide you over to dinner. Dinners were 4 full courses, very well prepared even if not memorable. Overall value was very high.",None,POS

We all shared a room which was not a problem because it was so big. The bathroom was also large and everywhere was decorated to a high standard. The food was amazing, breakfast was continental but a wide choice of food was available. Dinner was something to look forward to, six courses, a few evenings we didn't manage all the courses because of the amount of food to be consumed. Every evening there was a different menu with plenty of choice and the food was cooked to a high standard.

“Excellent stay at village hotel”,"We decided to stay at Hotel Maria because of the recommendations made by other travelers, and we weren't disappointed. We'd driven from the Piemonte region to hike in the Dolomites for 6 days. At the time of arrival, we found it difficult to drive into the hotel area because of nearby road construction, but the hotel attendant was very helpful in guiding us in. She spoke little English, but we could understand her enough to get us there finally. With us, we had alot of luggage, including two large bike boxes. We were able to store them in their ski room at no extra cost. And after a quick desk transaction by the wonderful lady there, we were into our """"double"""" room. We were so pleased that our room was on the second floor and overlooked the little town square which had a wonderful view of the Alpe de Suisse gondola. The room was very clean and comfortable; not horribly large, but reasonable enough for us and all our hiking gear. Same can be said for the nicely done, but small bathroom. The location of this hotel is fantastic. It is steps away from the local (and other) bus stops. Buses can take you just about anywhere you want to go at a very reasonable price. We used it to take us into nearby St. Cristina and Selva Gardena, two spots that led to the trailheads for hikes we wanted to go on. Ortisei itself is within easy walking distance to two gondolas (Alpe de Suisse and Secada) which you can take to the tops of mountains and then you are free to hike in the meadows and beyond. Nothing is more beautiful than this setting! Very comfortable beds with simple down comforters. Very quiet at night. Hotel is frequented by tourist groups. We were the only Americans there, and couldn't communicate with anyone! Mostly German tourists in the area. The price for the accomodation was very reasonable, given everything it offered. We opted for the half-board since we found few places nearby to have breakfast or dinner. We did opt once for a dinner out at Tubladel, which got great reviews. The breakfast at Hotel Maria is good -- lots of choice, but the same choices are offered every day. The Tyrolean dinner was OK, nothing special. But all that was important to us was getting food in our stomachs after long days of hiking. The only thing I found difficult was trying to make the reservation with a credit card. First, it was hard to get anyone to answer the phone (I'd called in October, the off-season); second, it was difficult to make the credit card transaction because none is offered on-line. I had to call it in. Could we have stayed at a nicer place? Yes, but Hotel Maria was just about everything we hoped it would be. Could we have stayed in a more convenient spot? Maybe Selva Gardena may have been a better choice because it's a bigger town and there are more shops to meander through; however, Ortesei is quaint and beautiful. And the service at Hotel Maria was top notch for a 3* hotel. I'd recommend it to my friends without hesitation. Room Tip: Ask for a room overlooking the square.

"“The perfect place to stay near Ortisei, Italy”","Just completed a terrific two night stay at the Hotel Scherlin. While it is about five kilometers up from the valley floor town of Ortisei, an easy distance by car, it has commanding views of the valley, surrounding steep slopes and distant mountains. There is also a local bus stop right across from the hotel. This private family owned and operated hotel is only two years old, as it recently underwent an extensive addition and remodel in the location of its former self. Run efficiently by Tiziana and her husband, it proved the perfect place from which to explore the area, with our major goal the Sella Group of mountain passes in the Dolomites. The day we arrived, it was raining heavily, but the garage under the hotel kept us dry as we unloaded our luggage and rode the lift to our floor. Fortunately, the following day was clear and sunny, the views stunning, and we could easily hear the church bells from Ortisei in the valley below. Tiziana provided touring suggestions and was a delight during our entire stay. We had a standard room, the smallest offered, but there was nothing standard about it, as the size was larger than many suites we have stayed in. The views from our room were impressive, and we had a very nice terrace as well. Equipped with a completely modern bath, large closet area, comfortable bed and numerous outlets, we had everything we might need. The Internet wifi is not as fast as we would like but certainly acceptable in the rural location. Breakfast offered a quite adequate selection of the usual items, and eggs can be made to order as well. Lunch and dinner are also offered if desired. A refrigerator in the room would have been nice, since the hotel is a distance from town. The hotel has an indoor/outdoor swimming pool, Jacuzzi spa, sauna and children’s play equipment in the lawn area. The entire hotel was spotless, and the guest service we experienced among the best on our current three month trip. When we made our reservations months earlier, we found that many of the accommodations in town were not available, because they were closed for the off-season just before summer. That was our good fortune, as staying in this superb hotel proved to be the best choice in the area. If we were here again, we would stay at this hotel just for the view and enjoy all the other attributes that come with it. Room Tip: Ask for a second or third floor room for the better views.

“What a gem!”,"We traveled to Ortisei in the summer (for the first time in the region in the summer, we usually go skiing here) for a mini honeymoon and chose this hotel because it looked lovely, it had a small spa which was really important to me, and was centrally located. We wanted nice but nothing over the top. This hotel ticks all of the boxes and then some. I am going to start of by saying that the service and the people that work there take this lovely hotel to a whole different level. The young lady (whose name unfortunately I did not get) who worked at reception on almost all of the 5 days we were there was really great with great restaurant recommendations and advice that she could well be a top concierge in a 5 star hotel! The hotel is really nicely decorated in the Ladin style, it is incredibly clean, the spa looked like it was opened the day before we arrived, it was the perfect mix of bigger hotel and small family owned hotel, the breakfast was great, the location could not be more central... I don't know I can say anything bad. If I had to nit pick I can say that the bed was a bit on the hard side, but that is nit picking. We got upgraded to a suite because we were on our honey moon and our room was wonderful with a west facing balcony and lovely sun in the afternoons. I can't comment on the regular rooms that we had booked because of the upgrade, but I would highly recommend splurging on the suite if you are there on a special occasion.

The Hungarian girl who works there was very nice and gave us lots of advice about Ortisei. They have delicious pastries and strong coffee. My favourite was their Vin brule which was delicious! Next time we hope to stay in the hotel as well. Thanks for making our stay in Ortisei even better thanks to your friendly staff!,couple,POS

“Wonderful stay”,"Just returned from a wonderful stay at the Classic Hotel am Stetteneck. The hotel is excellent in every which detail you look for. It is so well located. Right in the city center and only a few minutes away walk from the both gondolas (Alpe de Siusi and Secada) The setting couldn't be more magical with views of the village and mountains all around. Staff is highly professional and very friendly. From the minute we arrived we were well looked after. Hotel is spotless clean everywhere. Decorations is so charming.Our room had great views of the town and the mountains, a balcony, lots of space, comfy beds, shower and bath - overall very comfortable and a pleasure to spend time in. Free Wi-fi. Delicious breakfast buffet was really awesome: everything you might want to eat in the morning was there. Eggs, sausages, bacon, juice, all sorts of cheese, muesli, flakes, jam, pastry, and much more and very attentive service. The pool is very nice with windows and the spa is a wonderful treat and the perfect place to relax after a day on the slopes. Seriously we were very happy to spend a week in this hotel and highly recommend it. Look no further.",couple,POS
“Excellent choice”,"We stayed 3 nights at Hotel am Stetteneck in August 2012 and were very pleased with this hotel. Our room had a balcony with a nice view. Included breakfast in the hotel dining room was good and plentiful, the central location convenient, and all the staff people from the cleaning people to the cheerful guy in the dining room to the kind gentleman who was sometimes at the front desk and whose grandfather built the hotel, were courteous and friendly. A special thanks (and buongiorno, if she read this) to Marlies, who was very knowledgeable and helpful in answering all our questions, and who spoke perfect English so that my limited German and Italian didn't get in the way too much. While we were there, work was ongoing on the new pool/spa downstairs, which will only make a great property better still. We like nice but comfortable places to stay with a bit of personality and without the price or stuffiness of a 5-star resort, and for our needs, Stetteneck was perfect. If we have opportunity to return to the beautiful Val Gardena area again, we would gladly stay right here.",couple,POS
"“Very, very nice--but look before you agree.”","Stayed here twice within a week and found out an important fact about the am Stetteneck: look at your room before you agree. Not that some rooms are below standard. They are lovely. It's just that for the same rate, there is a terrific difference in size and decor. We had a rambling, spacious (and a little quirky) top floor room with a large balcony. Five days later we landed in a very nice, but considerably smaller, room without a balcony. Friends of ours had a terrific shower, bathroom and balcony. We had a nice, standard bath and no balcony. Same price. All rooms were very nice--it's just that some were like a corporate hotel and some had all the touches to make them memorable. Check the room first, and ask to see what else they might have.

"“nice hotel, stinky attitude”","ok so the hotel is nice indeed, i had a nice room, the lobby is nice, location in the center, but: the staff (i guess the owners) are a bit snobbish. I booked a room for a week which cost me almost 1000 euro and when i asked for a free wifi they said they sorry and it will cost me 10 cent/m, then they offered a discount for 5 cent/m. now what kind of greediness is that?!!!!! you have free wifi on every ski lift. you get free wifi in the bar next to ski lift for buying a damn 3 euro beer. I went to my friends hotel Maria Hotel to dinner with them, the dinner costed 20 euro, not 1000 and I've got a free wifi with a smile from the staff of that Maria Hotel. so it was very annoying and it spoiled any nice impressions about the hotel Room Tip: I was in the 419 which is like a suite. very spacious but without a balcony.

The rooms are seem to be very clean, spacious, organized, well equipped, very well maintained and pleasant to stay in. The meals and the food were done and served in meticulous way with high level of service and of course very tasty. We had a large impression from the hotel design. We liked very much the idea of combination between the old and new. The antique items in the hotel like the furnitures, the lumps and pictures are very impressing. All of this in a renovated building, well equipped, cosy and warm. In summary, we enjoyed very much staying in the hotel.

There was also noise comming from the terass outside and from the room of the neighbours. Better not book with a tour operator, but with internet.

“Fantastic Apartment”,"We stayed in one of the new apartments at the Hotel Cosmea and it was wonderful. Everything new. So clean! You only just a few steps away from crossing the bridge and being in the center of town. There was a morning we didn't feel like making breakfast so we were allowed to eat at the hotel which was very convenient. Same for dinner if you wanted as well. The hotel also has a small cafe/bar, which locals seem to enjoy spending time at. The cafe was nice for stopping in for a glass of wine in the evening. The apartment had everything you could want. We were surprised how well outfitted it was and at the quality of everything. Thought and time went into it. They have every type of wine glass imaginable and everything you need to cook a full dinner. I could have easily lived there. There are shutters which you can open and close with the flip of the switch - they keep the sun out in the morning and I imagine they will keep the cold out in the winter. The owners couldn't have been nicer. The temperature really dropped low when we were there, even though it was early September, so Oskar stopped by in the evening to turn the hot towel rack on. The bathroom and towels were lovely and warm that next morning. It was great to have the large washing machine/dryer right down the hall, iron/ironing board, garage, elevator to the apartment, even a hand trolley in the garage for bringing all of your luggage up.

Indeed, we traveled in USA, Asia, Africa, but never, never experienced a toilet of 2m2 , practically with direct entrance form the room.

“Nice rooms overlooking nursery slopes.”,"We stayed here for a week's skiing holiday with Crystal Holidays. The hotel has pluses and minuses. Location- on the nursery slopes next to the children's mini club. The nursery slopes are NOT however connected to the main slopes. The Seiser Alm lift is about an uncomfortable 10 minute walk and the Seceda lift a good 20 minute walk. HOWEVER, the hotel offer a free minibus service to the lifts but this does finish at 5pm. Welcome- the welcome was a little unfriendly and we were made to wait from 1.40pm to 2pm to check into our rooms. The hotel was by no means busy and the rooms were obviously ready but the hotel policy is no check in before 2pm. Rooms- comfortable rooms with a view over the nursery slopes, a balcony, newly fitted bathroom etc. However the temperature is too hot at night and cannot be adjusted except by leaving the windows and doors open. There is also a notice on the fridge saying that if you use it for your own drinks, they charge 5 Euros per day!!! The wi fi is also expensive. Food- Breakfast is good. A selection of cereals, some fruit, yoghurts. Bread, cakes, cheese, hams etc. You can order an omelette freshly made. Dinner choices have to be made in the mornings and there is 4 for each course. Food was not of 4 star quality but acceptable. It got a bit boring by the end of the week and one night we chose to eat in town for a change. The salad buffet is good and cheese as well as dessert is offered. The desserts were not a strong point and icecream is the best alternative. Boot Room- Excellent. Heated boot racks within the lockers, space to sit down to put gear on. Bar- Very strange chairs and furniture. Almost no atmosphere and it never seemed to be open for a pre dinner drink. This was not a problem however as it meant that we were able to take a walk into town for a drink in one of the bars. Staff- generally helpful and friendly. The owner, although not offering a particularly warm welcome did become more friendly as the week went on. Swimming Pool- next door is a great swimming pool complex and the hotel give you a free ticket! I do not think we would stay here again, we stayed in a really friendly place in Selva last year- the Ingram!",friends,NEG
“Great hotel”,"We stayed here for a week over Christmas 2013 and were very pleased with this hotel. To deal with that unusual name first: Hell is a family name which also happens to mean “bright” in German, which is widely spoken here in the South Tirol. It did cause some amusement amongst our friends when we told them where we would be spending Christmas, but we were delighted with the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. In fact we were the first guests of the winter season, but everything was ready for us when we arrived early in the afternoon. Our spacious room on the second floor overlooked the village nursery ski slopes. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom included a corner bath with shower. Meals were good: breakfast was a typical selection of cereals, yoghurt, fruit, cheese, cold meats and pastries. For the evening meal there was a choice of first and second courses plus a salad buffet, a cheese course and desert. On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day a delicious set menu of six courses was served. The hotel stands on the river promenade, close to the swimming pool. It is built in the modern chalet style: the public rooms are large and beautifully furnished in typical Tyrolean style. In the basement there is an extensive fitness centre. A real asset, especially in winter, was the free hotel minibus service to the ski lifts in the morning, and back to the hotel in the late afternoon, easily arranged with a quick phone call. The hotel owners and all their staff were friendly and welcoming: we have no hesitation in thoroughly recommending this hotel.",couple,POS

“Comfortable and Friendly”,"Stayed at Hotel Hell from 21-28 January 2012 on a skiing trip. Very comfortable beds and duvets in a relatively quiet location. The hotel rooms and general areas were scrupulously clean. The hotel is a little way from the lift system but the hotel provide a shuttle bus, free of charge to transport the guests to and from the lifts. This was a very welcome service and worked efficiently - and saved us walking in ski boots. The boot room is one of the best we have seen in our skiing experience. The staff at the hotel have all worked there for years and are very friendly. Breakfast consisted of cold meats/cheeses, yoghurt, croissants, cakes and also scrambled egg with the obligatory tea and coffee. Dinner each evening consisted of five courses - salad from a buffet bar, starter, main, cheese and dessert. On the last evening, there were canapes and aperitifs laid on for the guests prior to dinner. The house wine was a very good quality and inexpensive. All in all, for the price paid, we thought Hotel Hell was very good value for money. Don't be put off by the name! .... the Hotel is named after the proprietors.

The indoor-outdoor heated pool setting adjacent to the wellness area was a definite plus, especially after a day's hiking. The buffet breakfast and dinner menus gave us plenty of choice. At dinner we particularly enjoyed the pasta dishes. The Val Gardena is a beautiful area and great for exploring the rugged Dolomites. The hotel hiking guide, Georg, gets a special mention because without his local knowledge we would not have experienced the full beauty and variety of the area.

The town of Ortisei is charming, and we left after seven nights feeling absolutely pampered and completely satisfied with our stay.

Our room, for 2 adults and 2 children (ages 7 and 9) was comfortable, had a wonderful view of Ortisei, and had abundant storage space/hangers for all our ski clothes. We arrived late in the evening and found a plentiful tray of meats, cheeses, and rolls for a late night snack. The breakfast service was perfect, starting with the best chocolates and cappucinos, served by a super-friendly staff, and completed with all the good fuel we would need to start a day of skiing. Our ski rentals were delivered to the hotel's ski room, and we were able to ski down from the hotel to the Alpe di Suisi gondola. As first-timer's to half-board dining, we had no idea that our dinner in the hotel would be a culinary treat. The 5-course menu was hearty but sophisticated - even our children loved the selections (we didn't offer them a """"kids"""" option and they discovered new foods to enjoy). Finally, George and all the staff were beyond helpful. We drove from Venice, and discovered the morning after our late arrival that the car had summer diesel and woulnd't start. George helped us with dealing with the rental company and the local mechanic to get the problem taken care of. Thank you to the AlpenHotel Rainell for one of our best vacations ever!

“Perhaps our favourite hotel”,"We first visited this delightful hotel about five years ago, and have returned several times since. Its location is ideal both for those seeking an active vacation, be it walking, skiing or cycling, and for those content to tour around the splendid mountain setting. The staff are uniformly charming and friendly, and the whole experience reveals high standards of management by the family proprietors. The facilities on offer are impressive: well furnished and comfortable bedrooms, spacious public areas in which to sit and relax, and first class 'wellness facilities', including a well equipped gymnasium. It is the food, however, which really sets this hotel apart from the competition - which is stiff in this beautiful part of northern Italy. The day starts with an outstanding breakfast buffet, featuring a fine array of locally sourced produce. If you miss out on lunch, there is a mid afternoon snack available, including soup (a speciality of the kitchen), cold meats, cheeses and Tyrolean cakes. Dinners are the highlight of the day, with some five courses, starting with an impressive salad buffet, and delicately flavoured terrines. This delicate touch continues into the beautifully subtle flavours of the main courses (which include a 'wellness option' for the health conscious)., whilst the sweet courses are a triumph.

“Perfect choice”,"We stayed at Hotel Grien with the children for a week of skiing. The service and hosting were immaculate with a perfect blend of individual attention to every minor detail or request and a lot of courtesy and professionalism. You do get the feeling that they care about you. The hotel is cosy and calm with plenty of private niches to sit in as a group. There is an amazing blend of traditional and modern in terms of design as well as the traditional dressing by hosts at dinners. The gourmet food was amazing including the vegetarian dishes. The choice to take half-board was the right one by far. The variety of the food on the menu left you with no need to search any further. We were even catered for children friendly food which was not officially on the menu. The service workers, the waiters of the hotel and the owners made our stay so pleasant. The location, being slightly outside the very centre of the village should not deter anyone. Being high, the views are stunning whilst you stay there, and the shuttle service is available on demand from early in the morning until 10pm as many times as you wish with such friendly employees of the hotel. Hazem, who amongst other duties, drives the shuttle and served us most of the time was just unbelievably helpful and friendly. Even if you want to get from one ski lift to another whilst already outside the hotel - they would come and pick you up. They would even help you with informal issues. Every query or request was dealt with immediately. There is also a two daily trip to Santa Christina (9am and 10 pm) and you are provided with a weekly bus ticket of all the buses in Val Gardena for your use. There is also a bus just outside the hotel, but as the shuttle is so efficient, you will never have to use it. Our Family suite was spotlessly clean and was served every day. In fact, in our case, twice a day since my children slept on a large sofa-bed which they collapsed in the morning when we left the room, in order to allow us more space, and came to re-do it in the evening whilst we had dinner.

Monica and Rainer who conduct all the hotel activities are nothing but professionals, but what makes them really special is their attitude to their guests. Both are very friendly and pleasant, and I could very easily understand the guests who return every year, and others who even return 3 or more times yearly. They succeed to act naturally with no sign of effort or stress in spite of their complicated and delicate everyday missions. Have to emphasize the restaurant which is a secial gourmet one.

We spent a week here coming from Finland, on half board. We found superb attention to service, felt really we were on holiday. The large spacious room for us and our 11 year old was so relaxing after a day on the mountains. The resort is a lovely family location, and the town dreamy-like, with lacy facades and lovely pedestrian areas. This hotel is on the outskirts of town, up a lovely road, which gives an atmosphere of really being away from it all, especially when you open your window in the morning to the view of the dolomites and the great mists that can swirl around them, and then the sun: great. The service was meticulous, breakfast is a tasteful buffet, with an array of fresh produce even down to fresh carrot juice, evening meal always a surprise, with five course menus, in perfect proportions, excellent choice and superb produce and variety. The hotel has a lovely spa, with a quiet room, separate from the swimming pool area, which we enjoyed after a hard day´s ski. There is no fitness room, which we certainly did not miss, but did enjoy a game of billiards in the game room with our daughter, Some evenings the hotel offers something, such as wine tasting, Grappa tasting etc. In a word, relaxing, caring, and superbly suitable for a getaway holiday. Thank you to the family who own it. and let´s hope it´s there for many more years :) Room Tip: We had a room with windows facing the mountains on two sides :) and a lovely balcony to take in the...

“very enjoyable stay in a beautiful location!”,"We have just spent a week at this hotel - our first visit to the Dolomites. The welcome from the owners was very warm and all the staff were friendly and helpful. The food was very good indeed - big buffet breakfast with optional hot dishes. Dinner was a four-course affair, with 2 options per course and a great salad buffet to start. the wine list is quite extensive and there was a wine tasting on the tuesday night which was very well presented. The resort of Ortesei provided some splendid skiing with lots of different pistes available. Altogether we had a great time and we can thoroughly recommend this hotel.",family,POS
“great stay”,"I have spent a week in this hotel with my family and we were very happy. Room was great with separate part for kids. Pool was also very good, not so big but around 4 to5pm we were only gests in the pool and sauna. Play room is also nice with a table tennis we abused for hours.... The food for dinner was something extra....like michelin one/two stars place ....

"“Ortisei and The Piciuel Hotel, A gift to all”","Our 30 day vacation started here not knowing what to expect from Italy or this area in the alps. My itinerary was to include mostly small towns and villages for a better way to see something that most have probably overlooked. Wow, was I ever right! We traveled from Maniago to the Hotel Piciuel located in the town of Ortisei via all the mountain passes. Beauty was everywhere including our Swiss Chalet perched above the town. The rooms were as gorgeous as there setting with white walls and light wood everywhere. The greeting was very warm and welcoming and the hospitality was over and beyond. No stairs to climb no rough parking and located just perfect for a trip to Ortisei, Castelrotto and Bolanzo- Bozen. All 3 are on the must see list with Ortisei # 1. Our balcony overlooked woods with changing colors,the Dolimites and a farm with many sheep and 2 deer that just happened to pop out for my camera. In the town you won't get the feel of historical events but you will see the beauty of what Italians and Germans living together can create (a special and unforgettable beauty ). The Piciuel, its location, its feel of being new and its staff is all first class. It can't get any better!",family,POS
“Wonderful time in Ortisei”,"If you want to spend a wonderful in Italy, skiing on amazing slopes, go to Val Gardena, Hotel Piciuel.

“Very mixed experience”,"Our stay here was somewhat strange. There was a mix up with the original booking, initially my mistake, but then corrected by me in writing. However, they never updated the booking so while we were expecting to stay for 3 nights we had to leave after 2 which we found out on our arrival- so not a great start. We also requested twin beds in writing but all rooms were made up as doubles so they don't read their correspondence. We were booked in on a half board basis, and the food is terrible. As one recent Italian reviewer wrote if you are nostalgic for school dinners this will be perfect. Poorly prepared food slapped on a plate, really not good. As we did not enjoy dinner first night we opted to eat out on our second night and told the staff in the morning we would not be dining at the hotel. However, when the hotel bill was presented we were informed that we had to pay for the meal at the hotel anyway. I think getting guests to pay for meals they have not consumed is very poor customer relations. The hotel is modern the rooms are spacious and comfortable even if rather bare. However, given our unfortunate experience here I will not be returning. The story does have a happy ending- we spent our third night in Corvara at the Hotel Posta Zirm and it was totally wonderful.

“Outstanding Hotel”,"My wife and I chose this hotel after reading a number of favorable reviews and we stayed for two nights in the summer of 2014. The place is absolutely fantastic and I can not say enough good things about it - the bottom line is that we look forward to returning!! The hotel is located in Bulla Puffels, perched high over Ortisei with magnificent views of the Dolomites. (Note: we were traveling by car making access easy, there is a bus line with a stop less than a block's distance from the hotel that we did not use.) The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are magnificent. The attention to detail was amazing - the owners work very hard to make sure no detail is overlooked and that you are taken care of. (Example: Each morning included a personalized printout of the weather report for that day - and the next - along with a sampling of a calendar activities available in town that were going on. Regional (Val Gardena) activities in Ortisei such as organized hikes, cooking classes, yoga lessons, etc... were listed. We had our own hiking itinerary and did not partake in any of these activities, but it was an excellent touch.) This was one of the most memorable places I personally have stayed. Please note that the cost of the hotel includes a daily 5 course meal that starts at 7pm...and our meals were just fabulous! They post the menu each morning (if you have any requests or preferences, they simply ask you to communicate these to them by 10am) These outstanding meals added tremendous value to the experience of staying there. While not an inexpensive hotel, the value we thought was outstanding. We look forward to returning!",couple,POS
“Splendid Hotel”,"We chose this Hotel because it was highly recommended on Trip Advisor. What a wonderful place and a gem set in a lovely part of the Dolomites. From arrival to leaving everything was of good quality. The most friendly Hotel that we have stayed in, nothing was too much trouble. One night due to a cough I put a cushion under my pillow and forgot to remove it when we left for the day. When we returned to our room later the cushion had been moved and an extra pillow was put in its place, the attention to detail that the Hotel excelled at. The breakfast was plentiful with plenty of variety and the evening meals were just something else. The menu is set but any dislikes etc can be changed at breakfast time, we spent five days here and didn't need to ask for one thing to be changed. We met one couple who have returned to this Hotel every year for the last ten years, that says it all. If you enjoy gardens its another reason to visit this Hotel, purported to have the highest rose garden in Northern Europe, I have never seen so many roses and the gardens are set out in a lovely terrace effect.

“Wunderbar”,"We visited the Uhrerhof-Deur for three days in September 2013. It is among the finest small, family-owned hotels at which we have ever stayed. Our room was extraordinarily clean, comfortable, and well-equipped. The view from the balcony overlooking the rose garden, sheep, and Ortisei was outstanding. The hotel's situation on the Bulla plateau overlooking the Val Gardena ensures a quiet stay. Dunia was an excellent and accommodating hostess. The food for both breakfast and dinner was both high quality and, for dinner, well varied, with good availability of local wines (Sudtirol/Alto Adige is a fine winemaking region). We drove daily to the various lifts accessing the high terrain of the Alpe di Suisi and the north side of the valley to hike the outstanding trails surrounding the Val Gardena and appreciated the quiet, beauty, and good cuisine of the Uhrerhof-Deur each afternoon and night upon our return. Finally, the Uhrerhof-Deur provides very good value for money. We plan to return.",couple,POS
“A special place”,"We stayed at the Uhrerhof-Deur for 6 days in June, 2013, after reading the rave reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews are not exaggerated. This place is beautiful and special. Our (Superior) room, with a view of mountains, flowers and sheep was lovely, comfortable and spotless. Service was uniformly exceptional. Our hostess Dunia seemed to be in five places at once, making every guest feel valued and pampered. The food was outstanding and Dunia accommodated our dietary needs (no meat) with a daily chat after breakfast. The area is spectacular and we especially enjoyed hikes in the Alpe di Siusi. This was our favorite part of a month-long stay in Italy and we will definitely return to the Uhrerhof-Deur.",couple,POS
“Peaceful Retreat”,"We returned to the Hotel Uhrerhof-Deur this summer after having spent a week there 2 years ago. It was perfect - just as we remembered it. It is in a very peaceful postion several kilometers above the town of Ortesei and serves as a good base for enjoying the Val Gardena. You can take several walks/hikes right out the door (though they will be uphill), and with your car can explore other opportunities. The rooms are very clean with linens of a high quality with plenty of wood throughout. Sometimes when a hotel has half-board the menu can be repetitive, but they work hard to develop a varied, delicious and elegant dinner each night. The family does everything they can to make your stay a good one.",couple,POS
“Perfect Posta Zirm”,"I never really and truly loved skiing until I stayed here. Just love the cocktail bar- with Claudio performing miracles in a glass! The rooms are fantastic- wonderful after a great days skiing. Excellent food, and wine. Everthing is perfect from the stuba to the Spa. A top hotel in alta badia and the dolomites.",couple,POS
“A wonderful place to stay”,"Both my wife and I are fortunate enough to travel widely and frequently. In our experience there are few better places to stay than the Hotel Posta Zirm in Corvara. In winter, the skiing around the Sella Ronda and Alta Badia are without comparison. Views are magnificent, and probably the best in Europe. We were able to visit this hotel last summer, which is also an ideal time to go. In September, the tree colours bear comparison with New England,and the sunsets are memorable. The hotel possesses some very fine and comfortable rooms. We had a great view of the mountains to wake up to each day. Both in winter and summer you can access the mountains easily from the nearby Col Alto cabin lift. The Wellness centre at the hotel is first class. We thoroughly enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere of the facility- which provided some wonderful treatments for aching limbs. The staff at the hotel are excellent. All of them are very welcoming, and we are sure this is due to the fact the hotel is well managed by the Kostner family. The menu is varied and extensive, offering both traditional and modern dishes. These can be both Italian and South Tyrolean in nature. Notably the wine list is well worth contemplating-it requires a month or two to work through. We enjoyed our stay so much we intend to return again this spring. If you don't ski, consider the Hotel Posta Zirm as an excellent base for the region if you want to enjoy the Dolomites this summer.",couple,POS
“Splendid”,"Actually I feel quite selfish now... it was sooooooooo good so if I start to explain I may have too much rivalry from other customers next season! Honestly, the hotel is really good. It is big but cosy, with spacious but warm rooms, clean but not scary sterile, generous and tasty Italian cousin mastfully complimented by Austrian delicatessen and lovely-friendly-smiley staff. We've been promised to see dear running near our window, I thought it was a joke about wild youngsters having après-ski parties. But it was the truth, dear do run out from the forest and curiously posed when we took pictures of them from the balcony. It appeared we arrived to Corvara during Italian school holidays, so it was full of local families: parents, grandparents, teenagers and little ones all together. Somehow it was all in an absolute harmony as Greif hotel is a family oriented place. During the days grannies took kids for walks around or kept an eye on them at spacious swimming pool, adults were skiing, teenagers were taught to ski. Italians are originally family oriented, it is normal for them to create the hotel where sound insulation is safe to keep you in peaceful quietness of your own room while kids are running along the corridors playing games and adults are singing karaoke in the lobby. Yes, in the evenings kids were entertained in a huge theatre room and their excitement very often was beyond the doors of the theatre. Younger teens as well as grandmas and grandpas participated evening shows as well. (But I discovered it only at the third evening, when we left our room deciding to have an after-dinner walk to crispy Corvara night) Life music complimented by karaoke and liquors in the bar was for those who were pleasantly tired form skiing along numerous lengthy slopes. To keep parents relaxed, separate kid’s tables were organised in the restaurants. Not bad for children’s social skills as well. Ski room is fit for purpose – big, equipped with radiators and boot driers. Shuttle buses were quick; drivers were nimble and very helpful. One more thing: it’s a massage services there for additional charges, which really worth to try. Sauna is free and also worth to go for. Probably it is not relevant, but the hotel is full of artworks: beautiful oils and graphics to rest your eye if you managed to get bored from splendid landscapes of la Badia.",couple,POS
“Good view from bedroom”,"Booked this from reading TripAdvisor feed back, obviously didn't read enough, if your use to Austrian standards then this will not measure up. Can't fault the room, was up graded to a superior room, great views, comfortable bed, shame about the pillows, plenty of storage, and great bathroom facilities. Can't fault the cleaning staff or the hotel and waiting staff, but oh the food left a lot to be desired. Breakfast was the same as most hotels but hot food was not covered and bacon hardly cooked, but the evening meal, was a really let down, minimum effort put into salads, starters made up from left overs from previous evening meal, cheese and maybe one cold meat, soups where hit and miss some resembling dish water. Main meal of meat could be fatty and lacking in veg, but on the up side the deserts where excellent. Not near the slopes so you have to rely on the hotel transport, which had two vans in the morning, which worked quite quickly, but the afternoon transport, was down to one van as other driver was over seeing swimming pool duties, this could mean a long wait to return to the hotel and finished at 5. To swim in the pool you need to purchase a swimming cap, the sauna only took 5 people at a time which needed to be booked and incurred a minimum charge, not sufficient enough for the size of the hotel.

“Couldn't fault it.”,"We had booked to stay in Arabba 1st to 8th February 2014, however on arrival at Innsbruck were re-located by Neilson to Corvara as Arabba was snowed in! We were sent to the Hotel Greif temporarily whilst Arabba was cleared of snow. We were obviously a little ominous about the situation and immediately named our new hotel as Hotel Grief! However, how wrong we were. The hotel is fantastic. We had a splendid suite style room which was huge (specially compared to the normal 'box rooms' which is the best we can usually afford)! It had a balcony, separate loo and separate bathroom, with shower and bath. If you can afford to, do book one of these rooms - it will be worth it. Not only was the room excellent, clean and very warm, we had a fantastic view of the mountains and slopes. The bed was super comfy too. The hotel is located on the edge of the village, so I imagine that the views from the Hotel are much better from the Hotels crammed into the main village, of which there are many! All the staff at the hotel were friendly and professional. We used the pool, which was great, specially the outdoor bit. The food was really good, lots of it and the service was excellent. The shuttle service provided by the Hotel to the lifts in the village was excellent - they ran two mini buses morning and afternoon and it only took them 5 minutes or so to do the round trip. The drivers didn't hang around, making sure the shuttle was fairly continuous. Brilliant and really friendly drivers. We usually ski-to-door so were a bit nervous of having to shuttle it, but again, we had no need to worry. Ski room was great - proper boot storage with heaters and ski/pole storage. (A bit cramped in the mornings but it didn't matter a jot.) Corvara village itself was pretty. Full of hotels/B&B/apartments and restaurants. As we hadn't booked to stay in Corvara, we hadn't studied the place but it turned out to be fabulous - great location for the lifts and ski runs. The skiing in Corvara was really good - for us anyway, whether you went left or right of the mountains. Might not be so good for serious black run skiers but there appeared to be plenty of off-piste and some of the reds were challenging. It was mainly blue's and reds, which were both great - some big, wide slopes so never crowded. We never had to que at any of the many lifts. The snow was the best we have ever skiied, powdery and light and we had fresh snow every night/day. We only had one sunshine day, so the visability on the other days wasn't too good, but ok with goggles. The views when the sun did shine were breathtaking and there were loads of pine tree runs, which we love. We didn't get to stay in Arabba - they had an avalanch during the week so remained blocked in, although we managed to ski through Arabba on the last day, (the only day the Sella Ronda was open!). It looked very quiet and the area surrounding wasn't quite so pretty and tree lined, so we were specially pleased with Corvara. We feel really lucky that we got placed in such a nice alternative area and Hotel by Neilson, specially after we heard a couple of horror stories about other guests who had to be re-located from Arabba. Would totally recommend Corvara for ski beginners up to advanced skiiers and thoroughly recommend Hotel Greif. I would not think that Corvara is very good if you like apres ski and night life, but for us, the peacefulness was perfect.",couple,POS

"“The Best Place Ever!""""”","We just returned from a month in Italy, and our four days at this hotel were by far the best of the entire trip. The hotel itself is a gem. Even the """"standard"""" rooms are far above anywhere else we stayed. The rooms are large, with a balcony overlooking the Italian Alps. The beds are comfortable, linens are of high quality, and the bathrooms (yes, there are two) are fabulous - there is a room with toilet, bidet and sink, and another room with shower and sink, so you are never in each others way. The housekeeping staff keep the rooms immaculate. Then there is the food! Both breakfast and dinner are included in the price (which is unbelievably reasonable), and the meals are outstanding. Breakfast is a large array of cereals, yogurts, fruits, cheeses and meats, but you can also order eggs which are prepared either fried (with bacon) or scrambled. Dinner is 4 courses, and by far the best food we had on the entire trip. The """"staff"""" is mostly family, and they are all incredibly polite and helpful. I cannot say enough about this hotel. Lastly, there is the setting itself. Ortisei is an adorable little village with nice shops and restaurants (for lunch), and there are magnificent mountains everywhere. We took the local gondola up, and then hiked back down the nearby mountain - spectacular views at every turn. Don't miss this place! We cannot wait to go back!

“Best part of our trip to N. Italy and Switzerland”,"We spent two nights at hotel Uhrerhof-Deur as part of our two week trip that covered N. Italy and Switzerland. Our party of 7 (two families) unanomously agrees that the Dolomites and this hotel in particular was the highlight of the trip. The hospitality was great. As mentioned in earlier reviews, the dinner was fantastic and the breakfast plentiful with a variety of options. We were very happy with our room and the views from our balcony (simply awe inspiring). The rose garden is phenominal as well. The only negative aspect would be the drive to get to the hotel - quite windy and not for someone not entirely comfortable driving on windy steep mountain roads. We plan on returning in the future and would not hesitate to recommend this gem of a hotel to others.",family,POS
"“If you like Italy, mountains, idyllic pastoral retreats, hiking or skiing, and great cuisine, this is for you.”","Perched on a moutainside overlooking the village of Ortisei, this small hotel is a perfect base for hiking in the Dolomite hills and mountains. (In season I would think it is equally perfect for skiers, but we don't ski.) The hotel is run by the Zemmer family, all of whom you will meet if you stay there, and they add a great deal to the ambience of this jewel. They are always available for assistance and advice but never intrusive, and they are of course responsible for the perfect order and fanatic cleanliness of everything in the hotel . They also created the terraced rose garden (over 3000 plants) just below the hotel and overlooking the mountainside meadows beyond. Mr. Zemmer is the chef and he creates truly great five course dinners every night. Breakfast is buffet style and the spread is awesome for variety and quality. We would recommend this hotel for its cuisine even if it was lacking its great location and alpine charms. As regards location, we would emphasize that the hotel is beautifully quiet and peaceful far above the traffic in the busy village below, yet easily acessible to the ski lifts and hiking trails by car or by the local bus. (We used the bus because we do not drive in Italy if we can avoid it.) One trail leading into the mountains and the lovely plateau above Ortesei (the plateau was full of wild flowers when we were there) can be reached directly from the hotel. Many other trails are accessible from the numerous ski lifts. I believe all the hotel rooms are quite large and furnished in very attractive alpine style. To ensure the best views, I think the """"superior"""" rooms are the best and recommend that choice. I should add that the Zemmers can be counted on to help in emergencies - and if you ski or hike in the mountains around Ortesei, that could be important. It was for us, as near the end of our week at the Uhrerhof, my wife broke her ankle while hiking in the hills above the hotel. The Zemmer family was extremely helpful, even advancing us the cash we needed to pay the local doctor, and arranging our transportation to Innsbruck (we don't speak German or Italian so that was no small assistance).",couple,POS
“A family run inn nestled in the folds of the Alps......do not miss a chance to visit”,"Awe inspiring view from our balcony overlooking the village of Ortisei greeted us once we checked into the inn. Dunia was so very helpful in explaining all of the amenities of this family run inn and spa. Her father who ran the kitchen cooked up wonderful dishes each and every night we were there. The dining area was spaced out nicely so that you had your privacy but yet if you chose to converse with another guest you did not have to yell across the room. The breakfast was probably the best we had of all of the 5 places we stayed during our trip. The meats, cereals and fruits were varied and plentiful. The rooms were great with big feather comforters on the bed. The balcony was our favorite place to relax after a day of hiking enjoying a bottle of wine listening to the bells clanging on the herd of sheep below. We will certainly be going back again. I would like to visit Uhrerhof during the winter and enjoy the local snow skiing.",couple,POS
“a small paradise”,"This is a small family run hotel. The hotel has only 17 rooms. It has a family atmosphere, but it is completely professionally run in every respect. The Zemmers did everything possible to make our stay comfortable and pleasant. The food, prepared by Mr. Zemmer, is abundant and excellent - a merger of the cuisines of Italy and Austria. We enjoyed a large , fresh buffet breakfast, and varied five course dinners. The hotel is located in a farming hamlet high in the hills above Ortisei. Surrounded by lovely gardens, including a rose garden with more than 100 varieties, it has fabulous views of the mountains, forests and meadows and of the town of Ortisei far below. It is convenient as a base for numerous walks in the surrounding mountains ( or for skiing). The house is spacious and comfortable. Solidly built, everything works, and we never heard our neighbors. An exceptionally large part is devoted to public spaces, dining rooms, and a fully equipped spa for after ski or summer walks. It is tastefully furnished in Tyrolean style, with wood paneled rooms, and local folk crafts, antiques and other decorations. We travel a lot in Italy, France, Switzerland and Austria, and we come back to Uhrerhof-deur from California every couple of years. This is joy - it is truly special.",couple,POS
“Mixed Feelings”,"Based on the glowing reviews here we booked four nights at the Urherhof. Overall, it was a pleasant stay. We will always remember fondly the kindness and work ethic of the owners. However; I do think that for Americans there are a few details you need to know ahead of time to decide if it is the place for you. Hands down the very best part were the dinners. Every night were five courses of the highest quality, great variety, beautiful presentation. It was a tad restrictive to have only one seating at 7:00. There were never more than 3 couples there during our stay, which is both good and bad. Our room was spacious, but had a very limited view. We overlooked the kids' play area, and you had to lean out over the balcony and look way to the left to see Ortisei below. If a great room view is on your list you might be better with one of the other pensions in this neighborhood which look directly out over Ortisei instead of being situated sideways. The best part about the accomodations is the attention to detail- the hook on the balcony to hang laundry, the little pincushion on the wall with a sewing kit, a separate WC. The worst part was a funky smell in the bathroom and a tad of mold in the shower. The location is idyllic, but difficult. We rented a car in Bolzano (not an easy thing to do). The drive was a bit nerve-wracking and certainly not for the faint of heart. In almost all places the road is steep and winding, with many blind curves. It didn't bother us, but if you don't really love driving it would be a problem for you. The service is outstanding. Attentive and caring, all members of the family seem genuinely hospitable. On the other hand, you do have to ask if you want something. Again, this fits our style but might not suit others. If we returned to this property it would be because of how hard the family works. The spa facility is a bit misleading. There is no pool. The saunas and small rinsing tubs looked inviting, but the facility is only open each day from 4-7 pm. Considering that dinner is at 7, you really only have the chance to use the spa for two hours a day. The biggest concern we would have about returning is related to value. We paid about 200 Euro a night, which is not a small chunk of change in US dollars. We felt it was inappropriate that everything was extra charges. For example, no beverage was included with dinner. If you wanted anything at all to drink, even water, it was extra. There was a mini-fridge in the room, but the prices were as high as at the Marriott in Berlin where we had just stayed. We felt that given the remote location, and otherwise spartan amenities it was not good business to also charge Big Hotel ale carte prices for amenities. In contrast, we stayed at the Torbreau in Munich where the mini-bar was stocked daily with free drinks. Small cost to the hotel, but a big pay-off in customer satisfaction. In summary, we are very glad we had this experience. We would not repeat it simply because we found other mountain venues a better match for our personal preferences. We learned that we prefer a dining time with a range of dinner hours rather than one set time, we really appreciate small extras like bottled water being complimentary, and that we prefer to stay somewhere where there are more than two other guests.",family,NEG

I imagine it would also be lovely in the winter. Be sure to have good directions to get to the property, and try not to arrive at night- it would be challenging to find.

"“Nice apartments, bad management”","Angelika's apartments are relatively new. They have a kitchens, but no ovens. They are nice. However, we had problems with the management. The website said there was wi-fi. It was very important for my friend's wife as she needed to work from her laptop while on holiday. We confirmed this with the owner, Ms. Zingerle, and she also told us it would be free. When we arrived, we were told there was a charge for wi-fi. When I said her e-mail said it would be free, she agreed there would be no charge. Except it didn't work for the whole week. Ms. Zingerle spent most of the week away from Corvara so we could not contact her about when it would be fixed. At the end of the week, Ms. Zingerle said she tried to get the repairman to come faster but could not. She refused to offer any compensation over this. In spite of this problem, we decided we liked the apartments and Corvara enough to book again this year. Ms. Zingerle first told me by email there were four apartments available. I wrote back but got no response for more than a week. I tried calling over several days, but no one answered. Finally, Ms. ZIngerle answered the phone and told me there were only three apartments, but still enough bedrooms for me and eight friends. I wrote immediately to request the banking information as she asked to make a room deposit. I got no response. Again, I called but no one answered. When she did answer, she confused me with someone with a simlar name. Then, she told me she had not received my email asking for the bank information (though this had worked with no problems before). She took my phone number and told me she'd call if there was a problem. Then, I received an e-mail a day or two later saying there wer now only two apartments, which was not enough for our group. The rest were booked for the week we wanted (after we had all made our vacation plans with work). She did not tell me this on the phone or bother to call me. We were all very angry. We would have been regular guests, but she has lost us forever as customers.",None,NEG
“Excellent hotel with exceptional service”,What a lovely hotel.... One that you remember among hoards of others you might have visited. We spent two nights here as rest days after six days of hiking in the Dolomites. And it was such a relaxing experience. The hospitality of Miribung family was excellent right from mama Rita on the reception to the sisters Paulina and Christina at the dinner service. The dinner is excellent Tyrolean food with ample salad options followed by three courses! The rooms were spacious and ours had a nice view of the hills. The hosts went out of their way and offered to drop us to the bus stop as we had to catch a bus right after breakfast. And the nice little personal touches like small trinkets at the dinner table did not get amiss. I will highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit the area.

“Wonderful Family Run Hotel”,"I have brought a small group of American skiers to the Pradat three of the last 4 years. It is a wonderful hotel with great food, superb service and outstanding hospitality. In other words, it fits to a tee the word Gemuetlich. Take the half pension as the dinners are very good and very plentiful. While it is not a ski in-ski out, it is a 1 minute walk to the bus stop and a 10 minute ride to the lifts of the Sella Ronda. Corvara is also a stop on the lesser known, but even more spectacular Gebirgsjaeger Tour or World War I Ski Tour. All are easily accessible from this excellent hotel. The Miribung family welcomes their visitors with open arms. The small, but cozy bar area provided a great setting for the Dutch, German, Italian and American guests that typically stay at the Pradat when we visit in mid January. Room Tip: Rooms with balconies have a great view of the Sella. Rooms on the backside get a great morning view... See more room tips",friends,POS
“Wonderful!”,"This is a delightful establishment that was a fine place to stay to ski in the Alta Badia. Food is excellent, service fabulous, and the value exceptional.

“Perfect...”,"One of the top two or three places we've ever stayed at in our 48+ years of travelling together as a married couple. The small family owned and operated Hotel Uhrerhof-Duer is as idyllic as it gets. The mountain views overlooking St. Ortisei are breathtaking. The grounds immaculate with a rose garden as beautiful as any we've seen, and the hotel itself simply magnificant in its simplicity and uniquely elegant style. Filled with antiques, and amentities found only in the very best of hotels, the most impressive feature was the warmth and genuineness of the Zemmer family. From the minute we arrived we were treated as family including a cup of hot tea and broth delivered to our room for my wife who wasn't feeling up to par when we arrived. Our lower floor room with walkout patio was spacious, clean, comfortable and with all the modern convieniences you could want. The evening dinners were simply special. A set 5 course menu was served with efficiency and grace and as good as you would find anywhere. A nice selection of local wines made dinner even more enjoyable. Breakfast was traditional but seemed more special because of the ambience and warmth of welcome. Prepare yourself for some thrills driving to the hotel which sits near the top of a mountain and accessed by a very narrow but well maintained mountain road. St. Ortisei is a wonderful little village and the surrounding area is an outdoor activists dream. Hiking, biking, skiing, or simply riding the tram and lifts, there is no limit of choices of things to do. Our favorite pastime was a book and a beer while gazing at the spectacular scenery. We'll be back and we'll bring friends. Room Tip: OUr ground floor room was vey nice, but our next visit we would ask for a room on the upper level wi... See more room tips",couple,POS
“This hotel was the height of our trip to Europe”,"The Urerhof hotel was such a lovely place that I memorized the name. I have very fond memories of sitting in the front room with a lambs wool throw over my legs having a glass of wine with my wife and looking out over the beautiful view of the Dolomites. The meals were very good and served with care and professionalism. Mrs. Zimmer is amazing. A mother of three including a three year old (Carl) she runs the Inn and is present from check-in till check-out serving meals, speaking several languages and all with a smile. I can't say enough, I love this place. By the way the price is very reasonable. This place needs more stars.",family,POS
“Very charming hotel”,"This is a charming and magnificent hotel just above Ortisei. The hotel is a lovely chalet in a beautiful and manicured garden. From the beginning to the end the Zemmer family does everything to make you feel comfortable and at home. The interieur of the hotel is very nice and warm, the rooms are recently refurbished with new bathrooms and wooden floors. Everything is very clean. The dinner is served in a typical Tyroler room, the food is excellent with a good choice of wines. We stayed there for 3 nights with 8 friends, everybody found it a wonderful stay!",friends,POS

“Excellent Hotel and Location for Cyclists.”,"Villa Tony is ideally situated on the Sella Ronda Loop which is about the most beautiful cycle ride I have ever been lucky enough to do. The ski room serves well as a summer storage place for bikes although I would recommend taking a lock as well for peace of mind. Our room was lovely, seemed newly done, spotlessly clean, great shower and a comfortable bed. Wifi worked in the room and we had a good view of the town and the mountains from the shared balcony. Management and staff all very friendly and helpful. It was the end of the summer season when we were there and it was quiet but the food in the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner was very good. Great for setting us up for cycling and to relax at the end of the day, a nice bar as well which was open not just to guests. The road through the village is closed to traffic in the evenings so is nice for a promenade and one evening there was street entertainment as well which was great to see. A town with a nice feel and a hotel with a nice feel. Definitely would recommend, would like to see it in skiing season!

“Another great stay at Villa Tony”,"I first visited here in 2007 when hiking Alta Via 2. The owner was very helpful and accommodating at the time. Since then we have returned on several occasions for shorter spells and two years ago we stayed for eight days. After an absence last year to stay in Zermatt, we returned again this year for eight days. Villa Tony's excellent high standard keeps improving. Our room was large, quiet and comfortable with an excellent bathroom which has one of the best showers I have used for a long time. The breakfasts are delicious with a huge variety of items, especially the local cheeses, hams and cooked meats. Dinners are always top notch at Villa Tony with a variety of choice and no repeats over the eight nights. The wine list is good and interesting and reasonably priced. Thursday night is Ladino Night with local food specialities and some live entertainment from the owner and family (it only lasts a few minutes but is great fun). Corvara is an excellent centre to explore the magnificent Dolomites on foot or by bike. The local transport is brilliant with routes to all the necessary hiking access points and buses in the evening for the return trip to Corvara. The various lift systems co-ordinate with these too and timetables are available across the road from Villa Tony in the Tourist Office. Corvara is a must visit place in the Dolomites and Villa Tony is a must stay hotel!",couple,POS
“Excellent family run hotel”,"What a splendid week we had at Villa Tony. Everything was just right - the management, the rooms, the food, the service, the location. We were 3 men on a walking week and we were made extremely welcome by all the staff. One of the highlights was the singing by the owner at the weekly Ladin evening. The spa downstairs was very well equipped and great to relieve aching muscles. We would certainly like to return. Room Tip: rooms on the front can have road noise See more room tips",friends,POS
“Charming small family hotel in wonderful position”,"This is a charming, out of the way, small family hotel in sud-Tirol with delightful details and features making it very special and homely. Beautiful gardens, window-boxes and a picturesque position above Val Gardena make for an enjoyable place to relax. The set dinner is included in the price and on the night we stayed was very good. Unfortunately we had arrived at about 8.00pm and weren’t aware that dinner was served at 7.00pm so missed the salad buffet which was a pity. The dinner, B&B package certainly offers very good value. You really feel you are experiencing genuine Tirolean hospitality and authentic cuisine of the area. We would definitely like to go back to the Uhrerhof and spend more time enjoying the many hiking trails and stunning scenery of the area.",couple,POS

“Most relaxing location of our trip”,"Just came back from a 3 week trip around Austria, Northern Italy, and Slovenia. Our time in the dolomites was perhaps the most relaxing part of our trip. We loved staying at Uhrerhof-Deur and booked this place in part based on the trip advisor reviews and recommendation on Karen Brown's travel website. The location is a few minutes up the mountain from Ortisei, on the way up the Seiser Alm/Alpe de Siusi, which is a spectacular plateau overlooking the dolomites. The hotel was charming, immaculately clean, smelled great. The family there was most welcoming and we enjoyed conversations with other guests during our meals. The location is good for exploring Val Gardena and you can easily reach San Maddelena which is a spectacular spot very much worth a day trip around the next Valley (Val di Funes). There are great drives around the area, and excellent day hiking facilitated by various chair lifts. You could easily spend a week in the dolomites. We only had 3 nights, would recommend staying for more, or splitting time between Ortisei area and Cortina d'Ampezzo area (during a week or more). Meals at Uhrerhof were delightful multiple course affairs, somewhat overly structured with regards to schedule (precisely at 7pm), but it eliminated the burden of finding a decent restaurant when you're already tired at the end of your day. Breakfast was great. Views down the valley to Ortisei were excellent, and overall charming micro-village of Bulla was exceptionally quiet and relaxing. Would strongly recommend the Uhrerhof to others. PS Drive or hike up the Seiser Alm as much as you can while you're there, drive up after dinner for sunset views of Seiser Alm and spectacular photos on a clear day/evening.",couple,POS
“Our FAVORITE Hotel on our trip!!!”,"We LOVED this place!!! We went to multiple countries and stayed in many different hotels and this was our favorite.

The rooms were so clean and the beds were soft and comfortable, furniture beautiful. The spa was a added plus. You definately get your money's worth!!!!",couple,POS
“Seek out this gem”,"My wife and I are just back from 3 nights in this lovely hotel. We arrived late at night and had a job to find it - we did not know that Pufels and Bulla are one and the same place! It was worth the effort! The breakfasts were terrific; the fare was plenty even for a man who salivates at the thought of the full Irish breakfast! There is not a choice for evening meals which actually worked out very well. The room was big and spacious and you would have no problem spending an evening there after a long day on the slopes. The whole place was spotlessly clean. We loved the hotel and would highly recommend it for a relaxing break. In addition to all of that, our charming hosts were delighted to welcome Irish visitors. Just be aware that there isn't really a bar so no apres-ski! To ski one gets the public ski bus down to Ortisei (also called St. Ulrich).",couple,POS
“Excellent in all respects”,"From the welcome at reception, to the comfortable and well- equipped room, the excellent food and the lovely swimming pool and wellness suite, everything was perfect. We spent 7 nights here and, strangely for us, we ate here every night as the changing menu was delightful with an excellent range of appetisers and salads, followed by a starter such as ravioli with venison or spinach gnocchi, a main course of fish, meat or a vegetarian option and dessert. Service was excellent and the wine was reasonably priced. Breakfast was a feast in itself with fresh fruit, cold meats, cheese,boiled eggs, pastries, breads,yogurts etc. After a long hike in the mountains, it was so relaxing to swim in the large indoor pool and then spend time in the sauna. A wonderful stay in a delightful area and we would love to return. Room Tip: Rooms at the back have a mountain view. See more room tips",couple,POS
“An Exceptional Stay”,"We stayed here eight nights and would do it again. The hotel is in a storybook setting, in the hamlet of Bulla, with views down the valley to the town of Ortisei. Every morning, I would go out on the balcony and look at the light on the mountains and watch the sheep grazing. In the afternoon, I could sit on the balcony and watch the afternoon light change and listen to the sheeps’ baas and the tinkling of their bells. It’s magic. The Uhrerhof is not only unique in its setting, it’s also in its ambience of the interior and the very warm feeling it gives you. The Zemmer family have an incredible attention to detail – whether it’s in the wall or ceiling decorations, the furnishings, the thoughtful layout of the rooms and bathrooms, the menu planning - and also the execution - this is a family run lodging with the services of a high quality hotel. It still maintains a personal warmth that makes one just feel so comfortable. If I had any concerns about booking us at a lodging that includes breakfast and a fixed plate dinner with my husband’s dietary requirements, that is gone after we arrived. I had emailed prior to making reservations and inquired and was told that there would be no problem. So when we checked in yesterday, I was relieved that Dunia asked to go over the dinner menu and inquire as to any adjustments that might be required. This was our routine after breakfast each morning. What a special place Hotel Uhrerhof is. Each dinner was a multi-course gourmet meal of local specialties – each dish freshly prepared and artfully presented. Be sure to visit the Rosarium, the five acre rose garden created and lovingly cared for by Dunia’s mother which has 5,000 roses of more than 150 species. The garden is ornamented with sculptures that evoke the traditional arts and crafts of the Dolomites. As we strolled through the garden, the church bell rang twice noting the half hour, the sheep’s bells tinkled and the mountains in the distance served as a dramatic backdrop. We are so glad we chose Hotel Uhrerhof! Note: The upgrades to the main road to Bulla should be completed shortly (June 2013) and it will make it easier to access this fantastic location and the Uhrerhof.",couple,POS
“Dreary in stunning surroundings”,"The Dolomites are stunning and should be seen by everyone, however this hotel oozes dreariness from the outset.

The breakfast waiting staff were good and the food was ok. I object paying to park my car €8 a day though you can park in the free car park that has no spaces! Internet in lobby only which is annoying in the 21st century. Would go back to the mountains but not this hotel.",None,NEG
“Disappointment”,"Extremely disappointed. Although we have chosen the economy class room, we didn´t expect such a low level. The room was roughly cleaned every day and the smell of cigarette (though we have asked for a non-smoking room) was awful. We got a room right above the ski deposit, so it was impossible to rest in the afternoon or in the morning because we could literally hear every step of the ski shoes and to worsen the situation, the ski deposit door didn´t have any dampening system, it slams loudly every time that somebody got in or got out. The service was slightly lower quality than you would expect for such a big hotel, it means, none. Don´t believe and “nice and friendly” welcome from the staff.

Breakfast was excellent , fresh juice, great coffee, fresh baked breads and to order eggs. Dinner was very good with the kitchen serving fresh local fare. The Zemmer family runs a well oiled machine.

“Terrific Mountain Retreat”,"Stayed here for four nights in September 2012 as part of two weeks in the Dolomites. By far this was the best place we stayed. The attention to detail and the welcomeness that the Zemmer Family provides is second to none. My traveling companion has a number of food allergies, and these were easily accomodated without question. Breakfast was great, and the 4-5 course dinner offerings were superb. But the best part was the nightly fire in the main fireplace after dinner. It is out of St Ulrich/Ortisei, so having a car is better than waiting for the bus (although it is possible). We would return in a heartbeat.",couple,POS
“Incredible Stay”,"We stayed at the hotel in early July for four nights. The location is storybook-perched on a mountainside in the small village of Bulla above Ortisei-located in the heart of the Val Gardena. This is a small family run inn of about a dozen rooms. The rooms are immaculate and have been recently remodeled. The owner Dunia Zemmer, her family and staff were incredibly attentive to our every need. We paid for half board-breakfast and dinner. The breakfasts were excellent and traditional European. The dinners were five course and featured cuisine from the Sud Tirol region. It was a great dining experience every night.

This is a truly fantastic family run hotel where all the staff work in an ever attentive but never intrusive fashion to provide a wonderfully pampered and relaxing experience. The family is ever-present in a hands on fashion - bravo!. From the moment of arrival and throughout the length of our 4 night stay (we came for only 2 nights and kept extending our stay) from the porter, to reception staff, restaurant and spa staff, all were nothing other than extremely professional in a warm and friendly manner. Then there is the food ....... excellent and an equally excellent wine list to select from at reasonable prices. The quality of the meals is of a 4+ star restaurant not the usual hotel half board basic buffet fair found elsewhere. The celiacs in our group were well catered for and vegan options are always available. Our deluxe double room was large and comfortable with separate sitting area and balcony. The marble & tile bathroom large with a bath and shower. All areas immaculately clean and the best wellness spa ever encountered for a hotel in this category. Hoping to return again in August for a longer stay...... This is one definitely worth going AND returning to......Thank you very much to the Kostner Family.",family,POS
“Mostly good except food”,"I’ll make it snappy: We stayed for a week of skiing at this Pension in March 2011. It was one of the last available rooms in town and we weren’t expecting too much. But there were definite good and bad sides. Good was the room size and furniture and bathroom, also the public rooms and friendly little bar were fine. Dining room nice, and friendly waitress. The location also worked well for skiing as it was right by the bus-stop for the free ski-bus which served Boe and Col Alto lifts, and we were often home from skiing very quickly indeed, to a nice drink in the late afternoon sun on the terrace. Bad was primarily the food, which for the price of pushing 1200 Euros for week half-pension for two, should have been better, quite a bit better. The courses were meagre and nothing at all to write home about, in fact very basic salad, thin soup, indifferent meat and really poor desserts. Occasionally there was a better dish, but mainly consistently poor. The other bad thing for us was the smell of drains which never left our room, and was so bad we sometimes left the window open and froze. Internet was also expensive. So, shame about the cooking, which isn’t up to it : - Sorry, but it isn’t. Breakfasts also meagre and without much choice. Otherwise it’s a decent place, if you don’t get a smelly drain. Try for B&B and eat out. Many great restaurants in town. PS> Skiing was wonderful there as ever.",couple,NEG
“An absolute gem”,"If you are prepared to drive away from the main roads, along narrow country roads, do visit this small family-run hotel. Its position is awesome - hanging over the town of Ortisei. Everything about it shouts tradition; from the building itself to the genuine wooden furnishings. Small things really please such as the heart with your name on it hanging from a tree in the porch. Very welcoming; charming rooms with balconies, and great food using many ingredients grown in the garden. A wholesome breakfast with many natural ingredients.

“Superb Family Hotel in Wonderful Setting”,"This small hotel is perched on the edge of a ravine overlooking Val Gardena, with a wonderful view of Ortesei/St Ulrich in the valley below. It is built in the traditional Tyrolean style, with its own beautifully-designed split-level garden at the back.From the moment we arrived the service was excellent. The hotel is owned and operated by the Zemmer family, with daughter Durnia being receptionist, waitress and general fount of information and advice on what to do and see in the area. We had booked a Superior room on the upper floor, and this turned out to be spacious, as good as new, with a WC separate from the bathroom, a large balcony and all impeccably clean. Evening meals are part of the reservation arrangement, and we thought that this might be quite limiting, but as it turned out they were in some ways the highlight of our experience there. The dinner consisted of 6 manageable courses, all stylishly presented and all delicious. But the icing on the cake, so to speak, was the very attentive yet unobtrusive service of Durnia. Nothing was too much trouble for her. While we were there we had reason to contact home several times, and were given every help we needed for this. All in all a wonderful experience. What a difference it makes to stay in a hotel where the owners actually run the place and demonstrate that they care about their guests!",couple,POS
"“Comfort, views and fantastic people”","The location of the hotel is really good, in the middle of town and with off-street parking. The family run place is very homely, warm and welcoming and the room we stayed in had a lovely view of the mountains and cable car (which gave it character, a good thing). I had knee problems when staying there and all the staff knew about it, asking me each day how it was going as well as lending me their ice-packs. Diego speaks excellent english, and gave us lots of advice on where to walk, what the grades were, which cable cars were best to go up etc. I cannot believe that this is rated as a 2 star place as the rooms are really well designed and furnished with reasonable internet access included. The shower had lots of pressure, was always enough hot water and the rooms were quiet, especially if you had the windows closed. Breakfast was OK, with cereal, fruit, bread (which is all I eat) and much more. One afternoon, I sat outside in the sunny bar area and drank beer, talked with people and relaxed. It was SO good. I wouldn't hesitate in coming back here again, and in addition to that, Corvara is a great place to stay as there are so many walks from here as well as nearby areas.

Free use of a washing machine and bikes was a massive bonus with 3 children. The people were extremely friendly and accommodating. Everything was spotlessly clean and well organised. We cannot find fault and plan to return next year. Great place to stay with lots to do in the area. The accommodation is perfectly situated for children to play safely. A cycle path to the nearby villages makes it all the more accessible. The beauty of the river and the mountains is breathtaking. A field full of deer faces the accommodation and is an extra attraction for the children. All in all a superb place to rest and unwind.,family,POS

The car park is about 150 meter away, not a big problem, but you share it with other (not hotel guests) people and on Saturday is was so full that i had to wait almost 20 min for a free spot to park my car.

Werner, an owner, looks after the dining arrangements and he is an absolute gentleman and very helpful. He does have a good sense of humour. The meal we had was extremely nice and well priced. This was the value for sure. We had a room that had no shower, definitely not what was shown on the brochure. For a 6'4"""" man this extremely difficult and really not acceptable in accommodation today. We were not notified of wifi that was apparently free. The towels are well past there used by and the pillows were those 'aweful' feather things (if you like that then you will be in heaven). The room was very clean and well serviced each day.

“So so... rather expensive”,"I purposely decided to wait for about a week before writing this review as I could not sleep all that much during our night at the Croce 'Oro and did not want this review to become unnecessarily biased... still I am not quite sure wether I should give 2 or 3 stars... I guess 2,5 would be ideal... so here are my pro's and con's for this hotel: Con: - the hotel is really dark and a rather foreboding; - the rooms (we had a standard size double) are a bit bland, rather oldish (wallpaper peeling off in parts, etc.) and not too spacious; - the bed was very hard,the springs screaked terribly whenever I or my husband moved a muscle and the blanket was terribly scratchy (ergo not a lot of sleep for me); - the breakfast was very uneventful; All in all I guess that would have been OK but as some other reviewers pointed out the price of 90 EUR per night was WAY to much for it (though one has to take into consideration that the area in general offers some quite hefty prices for accommodation). Pro's: - VERY friendly staff, - a central location in Bressanone, just a few steps away from the city center, - clean rooms.",couple,NEG
“Inghams Ski Trip disaster”,"Avoid Inghams Brixen/Bressanone offering unless you are happy to spend your skiing time either on a bus (it's a 3 hour return journey to Selva where the decent slopes are) or simply looking round the very picturesque town of Brixen. Depends what you're looking for. You may well also find the Golden Cross hotel slightly underwhelming, although where it looses points for maggots in soup and uninspiring cuisine, it gains them in a surreal South Tryolean Fawlty Towers fog of half eaten board games and a gym that consists of an exercise bike by the underground garage. I saw no evidence of the rooms their bikini clad models adorned in the advertising literature. However, the staff were all very friendly and helpful. Bizarrely Inghams tried to get us to pay 30 euros per person for a trip to Selva, when the public bus is 10 euros return. Avoid.",friends,NEG

“Improves every year”,"I'm surprised by the recent negative reviews. We've been coming to this hotel for many years in connection with a conference, and we have never been disappointed. This year we stayed in a room in the Biohaus, a relatively new wing. The room was spacious, with a balcony, and a large bathroom with both a bath and a walk-in shower. Water pressure in the shower was excellent. Towels were adequate, but we needed to ask the desk for robes and slippers. Everything was spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable, though we would have preferred pillows with feathers to artificial fillers. Wifi was free, but erratic. There is a lovely new 'wellness' area with an indoor-outdoor pool, outdoor jacuzzi, outdoor sauna, and areas for relaxing in the sun indoors and outdoors (it was winter). Breakfast is plentiful and varied (I don't understand previous criticisms of it), and this year with delicious croissants. The front desk was friendly and helpful.

"“Great value, great views, helpful advice from owner, Brixen card!!”","Hotel Senoner Unterdrittl is located 20 min walk (with a bag) from Bressanone/Brixen railway station and 5 min walk from the central Bressanone. For me the walk was nice, as I enjoyed beautiful scenery of the Dolomite Mountains, but you can also take a taxi. It is very easy to find the hotel in Bressanone as there are signs everywhere!! (same goes for other hotels, though). The hotel is located in a historic building and it certainly has a special feeling of old times in it, in a best sense. I had a single room furnished in wood that gave it cozy and warm look. Mountain view from the room was amazing!! The bathroom was clean, towels, shampoo and soaps were provided but slippers and gown were not, no problem. Wi-fi worked fine in my 2nd floor room (need to get a password from Christian) and was free. No safety box in the room and no elevator, so I had to carry my luggage upstairs as no one was seen around except for the lady who checked me in. A negative moment about the location is that not only nice river is at the steps of Senoner, but also a road, so not oncewas I waked up by passing cars, especially in the mornings. I was checked in by a lady, but in the later days mostly communicated with Christian who was always nice and helpful and provided a lot of useful and detailed advice and explanations about the fascinating area of South Tyrol. Some people mentioned here that the lady was rude, I did not notice it but I think it might seem so just because she could not understand English well. Christian speaks English and it felt easy and comfortable to talk to him. For example, from him I learned how to go to the mountain of Plose, by cable car and which hikes are the best in the area. It was most helpful as information in maps and guidebooks available in the hotel is mostly in German and Italian. Bressanone and surroundings seem to be not well known internationally, which is good, as not so many people are around (Or maybe just summer is low season).They gave me Brixen card and with it everything is free - bus, cable car, Acquarena water park, great!!

My single room (with single bed) was on the small side, but totally adequate for 1 person. The rooms are panelled with wood in the Alpine tradition, a big fluffy feather duvet instead of sheets and blankets for bedding. The bathroom was spotlessly clean, and there was plenty of hot water. Breakfast was buffet style, there were 3 cereals and two kinds of joghurt, cheese, 3 kinds of meat, (ham, salami and Tyrolean speck) various kinds of bread,, butter and jam, orange juice, coffee and tea. The dining room is very Alpine, very cosy, and very Gemuetlich I paid 47 euros for my single room including breakfast. The reception staff were very helpful. The only disappointment was the restaurant at dinner. The kitchen did not live up to the expectations awoken when reading the menu.

Breakfast choice is very limited. Fresh fruit were a few tired looking apples and grapes. Carrots for making juice hadnt been peeled, you have to make your own boiled eggs or eat precooked scrambled eggs. Very slow service. Empty cold meat or cheese trays were not refilled. This was at 9 am, breakfast ends at 10 am.

They were accommodating and had competitive prices compared to the other hotels. Also, the location is very near the center of town. They got us a great 3 person room with balcony and clean, accommodations. The morning breakfast buffet was outstanding. We also rented bicycles and toured the town all day for 5 euro. Warning the evening buffet charges you per plate (around 4.40 for bowl & 5 for a plate). Parking is hard to come by, we lucked out and got a front spot and kept the car parked there the whole time. Wi-Fi was not working from our room. Also restaurant closes at 9pm.

“A good night's sleep in a great location.”,"We stayed overnight while travelling across Europe. The decor goes against the boring mountain """"stube"""" look: Asian mountain decor in the common areas that works unexpectedly pleasantly. Our room was tidy and spacious,standard decor for the category. Two pluses: a good deal of wardrobe and storage space and a big balcony with mountain views on either side.Got up early to read after a comfortable, quiet night and enjoyed fresh mountain air in peaceful surroundings. We were there off-season, so that probably helped, too - but we were 20 metres/yards from the train station, and would never have guessed. We paid €70 for a double on a b&b basis, which turned out to be better value than we expected, also because the owners issue a free Brixen Card to each guest for the duration of their stay (other hotels do, too). Free public transport, free access to 40+ museums and galleries throughout the region, free tours and reductions on active sports (winter and summer). Sorry we didn't have time to make better use of ours. Breakfast is fine, if you're okay with Italian-style/Continental. The Italian owners are a youngish couple: matter-of-fact, genuine, helpful.

The Garni Cremona is run by a friendly Italian couple who speak German and English (to a degree). The Garni is newly built, very clean, and offers good value for money. In Brixen accommodation in most (all?) hotels and garni/pensions include the Brixen Card for free which gives free local transportation and free admission to the excellent in- and outdoor Acquarena. Nothing feels better than relaxing in the 34C outdoor saltwater bassin and looking at the mountain you have been skiing on all day.

“Not to mention mountain views”,"1. You wouldn't be hedged round with care and attention 24 hours in this hotel. There is no even reception (but you can easily find the host if you need). You come when you want, you leave when you want. Nobody cares. And we liked this! Although someone can say that there's no service at all here. I'd say the service is very well and unobtrusive. 2. The hotel is rather new and well-maintained. Maybe only movement-detecting lamps in the entrance hall are not convenient. You can't slip to the lavatory at night without making light in the room. But we find it rather funny then troubling. 3. If you travel around South Tirol (as we did), you hardly find better place in Brixen. And you exactly can't find hotel with comparable location for such an affordable price. There is only 1 hotel in Brixen closer to the railway station and it is more expensive. Historical center is easily accessible by foot. Bus station (if you need it) is very close too. 4. Brixencard. I fear they abolish it my next time in South Tirol :). It's unbeleavable to get so much for free. (And yes, I know about location of free cheese.) 5. When you stay here for the whole week, the breakfasts become too monotonous. We also haven't found any restaurant near, but it is not a problem because of lots of them in the downtown (10 minute walking). 6. If you want to have any documents from the host before arriving (we needed one for the visa), you should explain it very clearly. And preferably give an example. 7. There's no info about Internet access at the hotel's website. We got Wi-Fi for free in the lobby after asking the host. I don't know if it is for everybody, or because we were from far away and had a rather long stay.",friends,POS
“Avoid this place - there are much better alternatives in the same price class”,"I always stay in Garni/Agriturismi/B&B of this price class, and I don't expect luxury. Simple is fine by me. Garni Mayrhof, however, is way below standard. It is a somewhat abandoned building with rooms in improbable 1960's/70's decor. Tiny bathrooms with a tub (no shower, not even a shower curtain). The windows don't close well and air blasts through the cracks in the frames - not the best thing in winter, especially considering that the heating system is old (hot water takes forever!). The Garni is on a busy main street outside of Brixen's center - with a great view over the historical part of town. This was not a comfortable stay, and I would not recommend this Garni even as a place only to crash at night. There are better alternatives! On a personal note, the proprietor also asked more money for the stay than was agreed upon in written contact beforehand (30 euro per person per night instead of the 29 agreed upon). At the point I was leaving I just wanted to get out of there, so I paid up.",couple,NEG
“Staff is what makes it highly recommended”,"Booked two rooms online and stayed here for one night. Honestly I did not expect much, but would probably have been pleasantly surprised either way.

Room facilities met my expectations and were satisfactory. Breakfast is tasty with kind and attentive staff serving it. Coffee is Italian, therefore very good. You are sure well taken care of in this hotel and it is excellent value for money!",None,POS
"“Excelent location, spacy rooms”","I used this hotel when I was in Brixen/Bressanone for a conference. It is great. The location is in the heart of the old town (15min walk from the train station) and the breakfast is correct. Rooms are very spacy. Price is not that good, but this is the rule in the city.",None,NEG
“Excelent Excelent”,"I use this hotel when Im in Brixen, and it is great, all the staff are perfect and the breakfast is just right. Rooms are well appointed with a modern look with a local twist, plus a little bit qwerky. Room Tip: Back of the hotel have great balconies overlooking the nunnery. See more room tips",None,POS
“not much character”,"as a frequent visitor to Bressanone, I was curious to check in this nice looking hotel I had only seen from the outside. I must say my overall experience was a bit disappointing. The hotel is OK, but you can find much more for the same price in Bressanone. The hotel is quite anonymous, as well as the service. The room was OK, with a nice balcony. The breakfast does not compare well with the other 4 stars in bressanone.",None,NEG
"“excellent location, warm athmosphere, good food”","Family running hotel in central Brixen is nice place for shorter or longer stay. We spend 4 nights with breakfast and Brixen card. Rooms are clean and big enough with good looking furniture and balcony. Small, private spa on the roof is perfect place for couples to spend time together. Brixen card is very usefull for variety of activities incl. town aquapark, public transport and even passenger ropeway. Breakfast is very rich and with selection of local breads and cheeses. A small complaint for pay internet (I think nowadays it should be free) Definitely worth to spend your time.",couple,POS
“Comfortable but not really worth the high price”,"The place was comfortable enough. It was warm and the service was good. The food was expensive and didn't cater well for vegetarians who don't eat fish. There was a sauna etc available upstairs but the steam room didn't work. There were no changing facilities upstairs so unless you packed a dressing gown, you had to walk upstairs and around the hotel in your towel to get there.",None,NEG
“Good deal with great view”,"We were on the way back home and would like to spend one more night in Italy. We found this hotel offered very good price and booked without looking where it located. Then turn out it was around 5 km. away from Brixen, but we enjoyed it that it was not in the city. The view we had, and during the night, from the balcony, cannot ask for more at this price. The room is basic, clean, there was free wifi and also breakfast is included. There few parking space next to the hotel. The hotel also gave 2 free ticket for the Plose cable car to go up the mountain, it was fantastic, great view of the Dolomites, and many hiking trails that i can stroll my baby around, we loved it there so much then had to go there again the next day. For the check in, we didnt have any problem as it clearly mentioned that check in is 3 pm. We arrived earlier and found no one, so we walk around and came back to check in at 3, staff was there. ^_^",family,POS
“Amazing view overlooking Bressanone”,"We laughed because all the other reviews said this location is hard to find but that's just the half of it. Located about 5km up a windy mountain road from Brixen proper, the journey is worth the amazing view. Just keep going until you think you HAVE to turn around -- then go for five more minutes. The views of the mountains are as amazing as advertised and the little town of St Andrea is quintessential northern Italy. There's only on restaurant in town at a neighboring hotel but luckily it's very good. The lift to Plowe mOuntain is a convenient 1km away. Rooms are dated but clean and large. We stayed in the annex up the hill with gorgeous views. Just one recommendation: bring earplugs. The impressive granite church bell tower ring every 15 minutes -- day and night.",None,NEG
“Begin the AV2 from here!”,"We arrived via train from Venice at dusk. A taxi (with GPS) zipped us up the hairpin turns to Brixen. Our host showed us to our rom quickly. We said we were on a budget and got an upper floor room with a slanted ceiling -- but with the US dollar low, it was perfect. We had a lovely WC and hot shower in the room! Our room, on the back of hotel, overlooked a small orchard and we could see down to the bigger city. If you want to pay more, you can get a lovely balcony. Breakfast was fantastic. Buffet style different tables holding hard rolls or sweet breads, hot dishes, and a large (nice) selection of different cold meats, yougurt and toppings and cheeses. Our server brought us juice and coffee with hot milk. We ate on the balcony looking across the gorgeous scenery. There is a Bank across from the hotel and the fee to exchange USD was nominal (Do NOT exchange in the airport as they charge a percentage). Two doors from the hotel is a historic church and old chapel. After walking around it, we walked up the hill. We passed a man waiting for someone to pick up his dairy cream can and another gentleman with a sickle cutting grass in the apple orchard. Then the mailman pointed us to the small walking path up to the chairlift and we began 10 glorious days walking the Alta Via 2 trails.",couple,POS
“excellent start to our adventure”,"We started the Alta Via 2 from Bressanone and kicked off the first night at the Goldene Krone. The staff was wonderful, as was the food. We had demi-board, as we were tired, and the fare was great. there are, however many restaurants to chose from in Bressanone, so next time we will be more adventurous. The room was very spacious and modern, looking out on the side street. And the hotel is right in town.",family,NEG
“Beautiful hotel”,"We stayed here as a group and had a wonderful experience. The rooms are huge as is the bathroom, beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean and comfortable Beautiful location 5 mins from the town centre.Excellent breakfast. Wifi is free.

"“Spacious, very comfortable room”","This was our most expensive place to stay during our 3 1/2 week stay in Austria and Italy, but it was also the largest room with a huge, very comfy bed. It was very deluxe according to our standards. The furnishings were amazing. The breakfast was also very good.",couple,POS
"“Nice room, good location”",A nice room at a reasonable rate. A friendly but non-english speaking gentleman checked us in. Excellant breakfast. The desk isn't open 24 hours but a block away at the Gruner Baum you can get 24 hour service. There is a good parking area behind the Hotel. Only a few minute walk into town which is a very nice town to visit with many nice places to eat and shop. The twin churches are also worth seeing.,family,POS
“Great Place”,Drove there via Brenner Motorway. Brixen is nice quaint town. Ideal for walking tours. Hotel slightly difficult to find as it is the Dependance Gasser of the Gruener Baum Hotel. You allowed to use all their facilities. We had a huge room on the 4th floor with balcony. Bath also great. Beautiful views over city and sourrounding mountains. Breakfast buffet perfect. Staff extreamly friendly (German efficiency meets Italian friendlynes). Enjoy the sunset with a bottle of local wine on the balcony. Perfect.,couple,POS
"“Great stay, big small hotel”","We (a couple at our mid-fiftees) stayed at this lovely small hotel for 7 nights. The hotel is about 5 munutes' drive from the lovely old city of Brixen (Bressanone), the oldest cuty in Souyh-Tirol. Walking to the city is peactically impossible. The hotel has a lovely view of the old city, a forest and hills around, and is very peacefull. You can sit on the large private balcony attached to the room and hear the sound of the river and the birds. Room is comfortable. Continental breakfast, fresh and tasty. Good and popular restaurant, bar and pizza downstairs (we ate there about 4 nights). No noise in room even if the restaurant is full. Free wi-fi in rooms. The staff (a familly) very nice, even trying to speak English when Italian & german are not relevant for a guest. We recomend using the Brixen-card every guest gets free of charge at the hotel.",couple,POS
“quiet and comfortable”,"The stay in hotel was pleasant, quiet, comfortable. Quiet mainly because there was public holiday and there were 4 people in the hotel. However, we had standard served rich breakfast. In the morning it was visible people preparing for next busy day.

“Nice Sudtirol Retreat”,"My family and I spent a night at the Waldheim-Belvedere and I must say we were very impressed with the location and the hotel. We originally chose the hotel because of the price (86 Euros) and the decent reviews on Trip Advisor, but on to the hotel. The location is outside of Brixen on the heights overlooking the city and right across a valley which has a rushing waterfall. I mention this because we heard the rushing water all night. We loved it but some might not...We arrived at night, were promptly shown to our room, and then went back to the hotel dining room for dinner. The room we had (108) was very impressive...it was large (the bed seemed like a king), was immaculately clean, had a large bathroom, and a huge, and I mean huge, balcony. So huge that it felt you could almost hold a little party on it and definitely a good place to hang out and take in the majestic views of the valley across. I must add that the hotel's restaurant was very good and probably has some local renown as it was packed with people during the time we were there. In closing, this hotel is one of those places that you don't think much of until you stay there and then you realize what a nice place it is. We will be back! Room Tip: All rooms have balconies but if you want a huge one, ask for Room 108! See more room tips",family,POS
“Just what you'd want in the Tirol!”,"While a small 3* property, the Waldheim Belvedere does not disappoint. There's not too much English spoken but you can always find someone who will help you with a smile. The hotel is everything you'd expect in the Tirol from the pine paneled dining room to the charming breakfast room. Prices are fair, it's quiet & comfortable, run by a family who obviously cares about their guests. The pizzas are wonderful and there is a nice selection of menu items for dinner as well. Would return again & again!",couple,POS
“Good stopover”,"Stayed here for one night (stopover on the way from CZ to Italy). Very easily reachable by car - good free big parking place, almost centrally located - just 5-10 miutes of walk to the old city centre and square. Good location for public transportation - opposite the train station and bus stops (which is also source of some noise). It is nice older family run hotel, with a spirit of nice history, the rooms are equiped with a bit older facilities - but I was satisfied, liked the spirit of classical wood materials. Breakfast was simple, but tasty, fresh and I was not missing anything. Staff was very helpful! Complimentary free wifi and brixen card allowing you to explore the local attaractions were also pleasant.",None,NEG

First language German but the hotel manager can speak very good English. Great value for money as long as you are happy to eat from the four course set menu - we were......",family,POS
“Nice hotel in a picturesque location - didn't accept credit cards though”,"We had to stay here at short notice when we were looking for a hotel in the area after our car broke down and were glad we found this hotel. It is quite high up in the hills above Bressanone and the views are amazing. The hotel itself was nice enough, rooms were large and facilities fine, continental breakfast was provided in the morning. The hotel is family friendly with lots of things to play with in the garden. The only major negative was that they did not accept credit cards so I had to nip to the nearest town (3km away) to use a bancomat.",family,NEG
“A wonderful option close to the Dolomites!”,"I visited Mair Am Bach thanks to an offer from an italian discount market. The offer included 4 nights plus breakfast and dinner. After the days, we paid another day more, out of the offer, 'cause the place seemed to us very very beautiful. It's quite far from Bressanone (Brixen), around 5-8 km far. However, you can arrive there by car or by bus. The hotel is in the mid of the mountain, covered by green grass and pine forest. The view is so beautiful, with the big alps covered by snow (also in summer) and the lower alps with the forests. The rooms are normal, for a 3-stars hotel. Soft matrimonial bed, with satellital TV and very clean bathrooms. The window is a big door to access to a big common balcony, covered by beautiful flowers and with a wonderful view of Bressanone and the hills. The hotel has an optimal service, attended to the detail by Helga, a wonderful and workaholic woman. The restaurant is the best side of the hotel, with good breakfasts and unforgetable dinners. I can't remember all the names of the waitresses and the chef, but their work need a mention to admired it. Everyone says that the canederli (or knödel, a type of gnocchi typical from the tyrol) is the best meal of the restaurant. I prefer to say that everyone was special to me. Sincerely, a good work!. The location is perfect for families and couples. Children will be happy there, playing in the small park of the hotel, that includes small domestic animals (rabits, sheeps, goats). In the hotel, you can ask for the Brixen-Card. It's a service offered by the Touristic Assosiation of Bressanone, that you can use to enter (for free or with discounts) in museums, public transports, the Bressanone public pool (Acquarena), cable cars and more, in Bressanone, Bolzano (Bozen) and other places in Alto Adige (Sud Tirol). The parking area is secure but not so good for little cars. They don't accept credit cards. The service of wireless internet is not included in the price of the room. Soon (as Helga said), they will open the service of sauna (included in the price). Good add! Sincerely, a wonderful option close to the Dolomites!",couple,POS

“In the heart of the Dolomites”,Colfosco is a great location to ski around the Dolomites . The Sella Ronda is well marked and has fantastic lmong slopes and spectacular views. Staying in this hotel is a bonus with great food and hospitality. Wellness area oké.,couple,POS
“Decent Hotel - Food not so good”,"This family ran and size hotel in Colfosco is all right. Our room was large and clean with a refurbished bathroom. Access to the slopes is just okay, as you need to cross and walk on the main road. The quality and variety of the meals was very disappointing and involved way too many German dishes. The spa and swimming pool area is nice with a very good masseuse. However, German fashion is to attend a spa totally naked. I’m afraid it’s not to our liking to be surrounded by middle age naked men and women with no discretion at all Overall okay, but if we go back to Alta Badia, we will stay in Corvara as there are much more things to do and easier access to the slopes. Going back to Colfosco at the end of the day requires a lot of queuing at the chair lift because it is on the Sella Ronda path.",couple,NEG
“A welcome complement to the dolomites.”,"This hotel is large (for the mountains) but comfortable and welcoming with an excellent Wellness Centre, great and abundant food and an accomodationg 3 minute shuttle service service to the slopes. There is no chance you will go hungry, you can get your ski pass from reception, the staff are (almost without exception) friendly, helpful and eager to please and the bar is a very nice place to finish the evening. We had a misunderstanding on the cost of the room (room price versus person price) for a group of singles but this was subsequently sorted out to our satisfaction.

“green oasis of relax”,"Driving on the road to San Cassiano is by itself an introduction to a magic green landscape towered by the Dolomites The hotel looks quite normal from outside and the rooms are ok ( probably if you pay for the upgraded rooms the quality will be impressive) , mine, by the way, was particularly small, with a nice smell of pine and unfortunately a carpeted floor. I'd have prefered wood on the floor as weel. The Spa instead is a wonder of relax and cosy atmosphere. Breakfast is great with fantastic choices of home made cakes and strudel. You can also found some choices for gluten intollerant. People is nice and willing to help",None,NEG
“Perfect ski break”,"My third stay at this delightful hotel. It's in some ways a slightly quirky establishment which tends to do things its own way but the eccentricities just add to the charm. In the last week of the ski season we were blessed with lovely weather and surprisingly good snow conditions. It was a bit of a disappointment that the hotel's private drag lift was closed as that meant taking a shuttle to Piz Sorega and the nursery slope at Armentarola was effectively out of action. Alta Badia was virtually empty - not once in 4 days did I have to queue for a lift. If I got out early enough in the morning before 10 a.m I basically got the slopes to myself. Our room was spacious and clean. It's very well appointed with ample towels, robes and everything else you could need except, perhaps, for tea and coffee making facilities. The food is consistently excellent. If you're not careful you could blunt one's appetite simply on the fabulous aperitivi snacks which actually make the bar prices seem really reasonable. Breakfast is a generous buffet and dinner is a five course gastro blow-out every night. The wine list is up there with the best I have ever seen and there certainly are some dizzily-priced offerings there. BUT stick to Alto Adige wines and you get some very classy bottles at very fair prices. Paolo the sommelier can be trusted to point you in the right direction every time. All staff are discreet, highly competent and nothing is too much trouble for them. It says a lot that the majority of the staff are faces I recognise from my first stay in Armentarola in 2009. Yes, it's expensive but in the scheme of things it's tremendous value. Previously reviewers have criticised what was very expensive wi-fi access. I am glad to say that there is now free, fast broadband available throughout the hotel.",couple,POS
“Fantastic”,"This hotel is filled with so much style and class the decor is so stylish filled with beautiful furniture and ornaments. Your room looks out over the Dolomites which is awesome. The staff are excellent and attend to your every needs. The food is absolutely first class silver service. Dinner is a 4 course meal, a different menu every evening, but allows you to ask for something else if you so please. Apparently the Steak Tartare is a must to ask for. The choice of wine is very good. After a hard days skiing you get to sit on the deck on a warm sheep skin with a blanket over your knees whist a waiter serves you your beverage of choice while you take in the amazing view. Very hard to handle this place a definite must go to and a definite to be back to.

We ate a couple of apples, tomatoes, a cucumber, one egg, one piece of marble cake and we each have 2 teas. We had plans staying in this hotel next time we come back, as we are frequent visitors, however after this insulting incident we will never stay here.

Our room was spacious with a balcony and a modern bathroom. However, the surprise came with the food which was included in our half board booking. The food was fabulous, first class. After a full day out walking in the Dolomites, the four course meals were a real treat. The breakfasts were also amazing. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to hikers in the summer or skiers doing the Sella Ronde in winter. We also bought some of the house wines to take on our travels as it was so good.

“Perfect!!”,"Just returned from a one week stay at this hotel for a family skiing holiday (2 adults, 2 daughters, aged 13 and 10). We were offered various room options, but chose the Junior Suite (room 103) which consisted of a reasonable size double room with shower room and an extra room with two single beds. The suite was spotlessly clean and well maintained daily. There was plenty of storage, which is often lacking in many hotels, the beds were comfortable, the shower room was contemporary and smart with plenty of towels provided and, despite my concerns after having read previous reviews, all rooms were toasty and warm!! We also had a lovely large balcony. Just one small thing we did experience was noise from adjoining rooms, although this was not a massive problem at the time we stayed. All staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful, although we had a few language barrier issues, particularly with regard to changing menu choices for the children, but the staff did their best to accommodate us. Simon, the son and chef, deserves a special mention as his service and cooking was second to none. The food was fantastic and there was plenty of it. The location of the hotel suited us perfectly...not in the middle of the town, but a very short walk. It is very close to the nursery slope where all the ski schools meet and there is a chairlift linking to other areas or a slightly longer walk to the gondola lift in town - without ski boots, this was a doddle, but with boots, probably best to catch the ski bus which stops practically outside the back door by the boot room, which also was kept nice and warm. The hotel issues lift passes and ski bus passes with no hassle whatsoever. All in all, we would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and we are hoping to return in the Summer months to experience the area minus the snow! Room Tip: We were in room 103, which is a Junior Suite and found it perfectly suited to our needs. See more room tips",family,POS

"“+ spacious cozy rooms, - partially inconvenient service, - in the middle of nowhere”","We chose the Turmhotel because of its good reviews by other guests and promising website but are a little bit disappointed with our choice. - LOCATION Although I love to travel of the beaten path, this location is too remote and in the middle of nowhere. Compared to scenic dolomites the valley is quite unspectacular and restaurants so far away that you either have to take the car or eat at the hotel. If you at least want to have some choice in the evening I recommend staying in Dobbiaco. Even Welschnofen is a sleepy town. Be warned if you are planning a stay on a Monday night, because all restaurants in the vicinity are closed!!! +/- ROOMS The rooms are as cute as they are looking on the website. Rustic but quaint and spacious. Each room has a balcony from where you either overlook the mountains or the village. However, you cannot regulate the room temperature yourself and have to ask the manager for assistance. This seems to come along with the hotel’s focus on seasoned travelers, e.g. the bathrooms come with a bathtub, extra handles and adjusted faucets. - STAFF The manager is super friendly but tries to take advantage of the hotel’s remote location, e.g. he tries to sell you his dinner menu during check-in. This one includes 5-courses but comes with a weird choice and steep price of EUR 20 person. Instead I recommend having dinner at the Durnwald Restaurant (closed on Mondays) down in the village or driving to Welschhnofen. - SERVICE Although the hotel’s interior and exterior is cute its location and service was a little inconvenient for us. Instead of a common free Internet usage you have to pay for the Internet per minute (1 hour is EUR 2). Due to the weird pricing I don’t understand why you have to pay for it at all but it seems that not many other hotel guests are using Internet at all. The external regulation of your room temperature was another point that I thought was inconvenient. Another weird thing is that you can exit the hotel over the stairs but cannot enter it the same way. What really bothered me was that the hotel comes with a restaurant but doesn’t offer an a la carte choice. You either have to buy the menu, which wasn’t attractive at all to us, or eat elsewhere - due to the hotel’s remote location this means using the car. BREAKFAST The breakfast had a choice of rolls, bread, jam, cheese, cut meat, joghurt and fruits, which is in summary typical for the region. Compared to other hotels we stayed at during our tour through the dolomites the quality and choice was ok but not above average. In summary I would stay elsewhere next time although the rooms and exterior are quaint. The hotel is too far off of everything and the fact that I didn’t have much choice for dinner bothered me. I also love to explore a village and its vicinity but there is nothing to explore by feet. Instead of Valle di Casies I would recommend to go with Dobbiaco, which appeared to be more interesting and busy. + spacious cozy rooms - partially inconvenient service - in the middle of nowhere",couple,NEG

“Excellent ski holiday over Christmas 2014”,"I have returned from this fantastic holiday with my husband last saturday morning. Its now new years day, and im still sorry i had to return home... We were made to feel welcome by all the staff who were friendly, helpful, informative and really felt like part of the holiday, after falling on my hand Louise (hotel manager) got me some ice, wrapped in a towel to use as a cold pack, and Luke (duty manager) gave me some valuable advice about gloves with wrist protectors! All staff were on hand to help with anything you needed. The food was great (managed to put a few pounds on...), there was wine with dinner, the afternoon tea was delicious, especially the cookies - even drinking english tea, tasted like english tea (and i drank plenty of it -as its available all day in the reading room). The bar was well stocked, and the AVALANCHE cocktail is a MUST TRY for any guest staying - its delicious. Breakfast was scrummy with pancakes, porridge or full english, along with cereals, croissants and the usual goodies. Aperitifs were a great start to the evening, everyone in the bar - with stories of the day! Including games & card tricks to get everyone involved! It was great fun. Sara & Mat the Inghams reps were fantastic, loads of information about the runs, area, buses - whats going on. The room was nice, cleaned daily, the bathroom floor was heated! (no cold feet!) The water was hot, and we had a balcony with lovely views. Due to lack of snow, not all runs were open, however as the days went on, more and more runs were opening, 75% open, what a great job was done to keep everyone skiing & snowboarding, in the resort area. We met some really good people at the hotel, my husband getting out skiing with them in a group, while i had snowboard school, from 9am - 11am daily. Klaus my instructor was great fun, and a very good & patient instructor. Well worth it if you are considering any kind of lesson. We are aiming to return to this lovely location at some point in 2015! If you are considering this hotel, you really cannot go wrong, its everything you would expect and more to make a good, relaxed, fun, food & wine filled holiday. See you soon Al Pigher!

It was my birthday whilst we were there and i was made to feel very special.

Inghams have once again impressed us and we would not go with any one else. Thank you,couple,POS
“Chris Wrexham”,"OMG what a lovely hotel. Everything about this place was great. Dave, Gail and the team were so pleasant and helpful and the food was fabulous. 5 stars to the chef and her team. Packed lunches prepared daily to our choice, and a wonderful 3 course meal (with choice) and cheese and coffee course afterwards. The staff were so friendly, and the atmosphere informal which we loved. The rooms were spacious and lovely and clean. The Inghams rep was also very helpful. There was a lovely sitting room on the top floor with unlimited tea and coffee, and the afternoon tea with home made cakes were fabulous. This was the first time we had tried a chalet hotel holiday and we found it to be preferable to a general hotel, as the shared dining made conversation with other guests so easy. La Villa was a great place for a walking holiday, it was easy to get around with a bus service and cable car lifts. Would we go back to this hotel again, YES MOST DEFINITELY. Would we recommend to a friend - ABSOLUTELY, Once again a big thank you to Gail and Dave, and a wonderful team, we had a fab time. Room Tip: There was a lift to all floors so access wasnt a problem.

And who can forget her great quizes.",couple,POS
"“Oh, the food.....”","We had heard the food would be good here and it was so right! There was a choice each evening which you book at breakfast along with your packed lunch for the next day. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice from the buffet and a hot meal cooked to order. You will never go hungry here. The informal atmosphere of a chalet holiday has proved preferable to us over an hotel as the shared dining, with tea and cakes in the afternoon, leads to friendly conversation. The rooms are clean and comfortable and there is plenty of hot water. I can also recommend the sauna and showers in the rest area. This is also where the tea and coffee is freely available in a sunny relaxing room on the top floor, also with a great view. La Villa is ideally suited for a walking holiday as it is at the meeting point of 3 valleys with good bus links to them all. There are plenty of lifts to link various walks together but you do need to check for opening as this varies each year due to snow levels, they opened the week we arrive 21/6/14. Again a big thank-you to Gail, Dave and all their staff for making our stay both enjoyable and relaxing. Laura, the Inghams Rep, loves to walk so do join her on her trips.

“Perfect - ski in ski out luxury”,"This was exactly what we hoped. It is easy to ski from the hotel - just cross the road and ski 50m to the children's ski park or 100m to the lifts. Skiing back works very well too - we only had to walk up a 20m gentle slope to the road and hotel. This was excellent as members of our party came on and off the slopes during the day. The hotel staff are all pleasant and helpful. Our waiter in particular looked after us very well. The food was very good. Plenty of choice (healthy/ savoury/ sweet) for breakfast. Dinner was a minimum of 4 courses (more on two nights in the week) with plenty of options. All was of high quality and gave us a good taste of Tyrolean and Italian cuisine. Our junior suite was well equipped (modern fittings, good quality wood furniture) and comfortable for our family of 4. The pool is cleverly designed, with its different alcoves and water jets - it's not really for swimming, but was ideal for us for relaxing after a day on the slopes. There's wifi only in the hall; in the new wing you can also connect to the internet via a data cable. We were part of a larger party, all with different needs, and we all felt well looked after. We'd love to go back.",family,POS

This place has had me coming back for better part of two decades for obvious reasons: - The location is the best possible slopes-wise: near the lifts and the world famous Gran Risa. - The food is unbelievable whether you're having breakfast, dinner or just after ski snack - The hotel staff's friendliness and helpfulness tops every other hotel I ever visited, were it the bar tender or the guy shoveling snow in the parking lot - The spa services are complete (Different styles of saunas, a pool, massages etc..) - Rooms are nice and alpine style So while the place is not the cheapest one, you'll get an experience worth every dime you paid!

It was only a few feet from the ski slope and in minutes you could be skiing the Dolomites. When finished you could relax on the terrace that overlooks the mountain, go to the well equiped wellness center or go for a stroll in the charming town La Villa. The main dinning room provides a very high quality dinner and breakfast that is consistent with the whole place.

“Gem in the Dolomites”,"The Hotel Santner is a wonderful alpine hotel with the most welcoming and friendly staff. There are some employees at the hotel who speak English, but not all. However, this did not hinder our communication efforts. Between our minimal German and their more than minimal English we were able to communicate and get all of our questions answered. We stayed in the Luxor suite, which is spacious, clean, and with amazing mountain views on 3 sides. We hesitated with booking the half board option because we typically like to experience different restaurants in any given area. Booking this option was the best decision we could have made. The breakfasts each morning were hearty and offered a great variety, including made to order eggs and crepes. However, it was the evening meals that were most impressive. The chef created some amazing meals and the attentive and friendly wait staff should not be overlooked. Magda, who runs the hotel, was the most delightful woman, happy to assist with any request or information that you need. The weather was less than cooperative while we were there, with the sun coming out only 1 of 4 days, but this didn’t dampen our mood because this area and this hotel are beautiful!",couple,POS

“MEDIOCRE AND NOT WORTH THE PRICE!”,"This hotel was the most expensive and the least pleasant of all the places we stayed at, and we cannot understand the positive reviews on Trip Advisor! Rooms are just OK (at least the standard ones: ours was very small, kept bumping into the bed!) Bath is even smaller (door did not open fully, blocked by sink, small shower stall). Heat lowered during the day even though there is a thermostat in the room…( if you need to “dry” ski clothes during the day, you are out of luck since heat is only turned up around 5pm…Really strange for a hotel right on the ski slopes!) Food is OK, up to the standards of the area, but nothing to write home about. Waiters are not well trained, so you wait a lot between each dish… Dinner is served during a short period of time from 7 to 8pm. Service is highly mediocre and impersonnal (except for Johanna, Matteo and the lovely cleaning ladies). The only good point is the Spa, a great place for families, with children jumping, running , screaming and having fun in the pool and Jacuzzi. The pool is large, not chloroxed out, well kept and gives onto the slopes. There is a very nice Jacuzzi like pool outside, where you can roll in the snow then get into hot water with the kids. There are also 2 large saunas, a nice steam room, as well as a relaxation room whose small fireplace is unfortunately never lit. The gym is also very nice and spacious. We just wished the saunas had be on earlier than 4pm on bad weather days, and stayed opened after 7pm (that would allow adults to enjoy the pool and Spa when kids are getting ready for bed!) The computer area is a tiny spot right by the entrance doors so it is very cold and drafty. No roaring fire anywhere as one would expect in a mountain lodge, just a mediocre Ethanol ventless fire lit in late afternoon. All in all, this is a mediocre place, which we recommand for families only. The location is good for family skiing, at 1900m high. However, be aware that, if the weather is bad (we had many days of snowstorms where the visibility was so bad you just could not ski), there is NOTHING to do, and getting out of the hotel is quite an expedition (you have to get the free shuttle to Compatch, then get onto the lift, or get your car out of the garage of their sister hotel (by the way, make sure you have snow tires or you won’t be able to park into their garage which has a steep driveway not often cleaned up… We were not made aware of this important “detail” and could not go up the slippery driveway upon arrival. After refusing to leave our car in the street, Matteo came down with a carterpillar to pull our car up to the hotel’s garage…) Compared to the numerous good accommodations in the whole area, we feel that this hotel is overpriced for what it offers and cannot recommand it!",couple,NEG
“Fantastic place!”,"This place was a fantastic surprise!

Napura is in Terlano, just 5,5 Km far from Bolzano and 25 from Merano. The place is new and with a very cool design (both the exterior and the interior). Very clean, the staff is very kind and helpful. Extremely quiet because the place is located in the middle of country, nothing will disturb you.Rooms are big, clean and well designed.

There are a lot of ski lifts in this area, and you are always at about 2000 meters above sea level or higher. The slopes and the tracks for cross country skiing were outstandingly cared for all the time, which gave a great skiing experience. The staff at the hotel is really helpful and the service is just fantastic.

The location is fantastic, right on the pistes of the Alpe di Siusi, which is great for families and intermediate level skiers. In the morning and evenings you practically have the slopes for yourself. More challenging runs such as the Sasslong and the Col Raiser require that you spend some time getting there first, so practically you're a bit off the dolomiti super ski loop. Try getting a suite with a balcony, they have panoramic views of the Sasslong massif, and were refurbished recently by a clever architect worth his salt. Very beautiful and luxurious. Breakfast and dinner is included and high quality, so as a guest you don't have to think of anything at all, and can spend your time in the pool or spa relaxing. Great concept.

On the downside the staff is unfriendly - you don't feel that you are welcome and that the staff tries to take care.

A little unconfortable, we entered the Sonne Hotel as only alternative, since we prefer a more authentic atmosphere of the Austrian/Italian montains. But our initial preception was misleading. Although we entered at the end of lunch time, we were welcomed and served gently, swiftly, with a lot of humour, in a family like atmosphere. We had a good time and good food.",friends,POS

“Perfect location and a very nice dining experience”,"We arrived to the hotel by driving through the ski area, crossing the actual slopes which was very exciting. The hotel is placed in the middle of the mountain and has the most beautiful surroundings. Next to the hotel is the ski school and childrens """"fun park"""" which is perfect if you are travelling with small children. At the hotel they (almost) have their own ski rental service - we arrived late in the afternoon and they had someone there waiting for us to help us getting ready with the skis. So the next morning we only had to go down to St. Ulrich Ortisei with the lift to get the ski passes which was less than one hour in total. The hotel staff was very friendly and especially in the restaurant they were very smiling and attentive to the children. Dinner was excellent!! Every evening they served different delicious Tyrolean and Italian classics and specialties and we also had some tasty wines. The hotel also has a very nice pool for both swimming peacefully in the morning - while enjoying the view of the sun arising over the mountains - and for the children to relax after a long day on the slopes. For the adults there is a fine sauna area and we enjoyed also the service of sport massages for those aching muscles. The only thing we could have wished differently was an open view to the skiing area, but unfortunately all the family rooms are to the other side so that was not possible.

"“mixed impressions, confused by the concept”","The Napura left me somewhat perplexed; not sure they have a clear idea of who they perceive as their target audience. Their image and pricing does not match the service level, or rather vice versa. Welcome was friendly, check-in and check-out procedures efficient, and information very clear. Rooms are certainly spacious, with good-sized balconies, and very comfortable beds. Lots of wardrobes, but a lack of hangers. Housekeeping unfortunately does not have a very sharp eye on all bits ans spots here and there. Parking directly underneath the hotel is great, and there's a luggage trolley; I would still expect to at least be offered help with the luggage, out of courtesy. There are prints and paintings displayed on all the corridors, and splashes of originality (NB armchairs )- and let's not debate taste; in any case they invested in being different, which I appreciate. Why don't they invest more in better breakfast though? The choice and quality left me totally dissatisfied - but given that you're surrounded by SouthTyrolian food and wine, skipping breakfast is not a drama. When asking for dinner suggestions at the reception, we were surprised to be pointed to the local pizzeria. Maybe this is the best pizzeria in Italy - but at Napura's price, image and location, would you not think your clients may want to sample local wine, food and atmosphere in one of the many original and delicious restraurants that are splattered all around? The roof terrace is huge with plenty of lounge chairs, the whirlpools add a nice touch, giving your some kind of cruise boat feeling in an ocean of apple trees. We did try the wellness area, so cannot comment further. The bartender on the terrace however is not professional - when asked for a local schnaps (after a tyrolean dinner), he said he did not have it cold, and served a fruit liqueur instead. If you don't understand the two faux-pas here, you will be fine - if you do, don't try the bar but stay on your balcony with the wine you bought at one of the cantine. The location is great for trips in all directions of the wine area and also to include some mountain activity or city visits. So not a bad experience, but not a satisfactory one. If I spend that kind of budget on a hotel, I expect better quality of service, not only space and comfy beds and fancy garters on armchairs. Napura should reconsider its concept and its target business, and then adapt either service or pricing.

Great place to explore the Dolomites, do hiking trips in the park without taking the car and when you return at night you can be sure to enjoy a delicious dinner. There is a new dinning room in the hotel which is very nicely furnished and cosy alpen-style. Unfortunately it was always closed and we were eating in the """"old"""" one. Beautiful views, not very cosy, and missing some ambient lightening, no candles, spots on the ceiling. We thought it a pity that the hotel does not carry any daily newspaper (german & english at least) for customers to read in the lobby. Missing some basic toiletry items (shampoo, cotton pads and kleenex) - only bar soap was provided. Last time we stayed there they had crusty, delicious bread for dinner and in the morning we just had a really basic, not fresh bread loaf and hardish buns.

Hats off to the chef and the waiter who was attentive but not intrusive. Unusually low price of 14 euros each, given the abundance and quality of food. The buffet alone could’ve made a meal. Breakfast was also abundant with breads, cereals, fish, and cheeses. Spacious room and bath--all very comfortable. Great location for trails.

"“Beautiful Facility, Short on Warmth”","The Alpe di Siusi/ Seiser Alm is astoundingly beautiful and if you are contemplating a trip there you should definitely go. We went in mid-July and although the flowers were just past their peak, it was still amazing. If I had it to do over, I would stay in Castelrotto and ride the long lift up every day. We stayed at Alpenhotel Panorama, and being that far up in the valley makes the experience more like being aboard a cruise ship than in a regular hotel--you and the staff spend a lot of time together. Thus, any deficiencies are magnified. The Hotel is well situated at the top end of a lift and has a fantastic view. The rooms were impeccably clean. The food was OK-Good. The service was cold and unfriendly. There was one woman at the desk who was exceptionally kind--everyone else did not want to deal with you. The staff website is in English and they seemed to be marketing themselves towards English speakers, but we were the only non-German or non-Italians in the place. When we went to the dining room we were ignored and sometimes had to wait 20-30 minutes before we could get drinks (dinner is set-up like a cruise ship, everyone arrives at 7). Once we were the first to be seated but the last to leave, not because we were slow to eat, but simply because they ignored us. A pertinent question at this point is: Are we offending them somehow? My wife and I have been very cognizant of the possibility of being """"The Ugly American"""" when we travel--however, this before started right away, before we even had a chance to offend them. One possibility is that no one wanted to deal with the annoying English speakers? Regardless, I expect better from a hotel in this price range. The WiFi never worked the entire time we were there. When I went to the desk for help the owner's daughter was unconcerned. Basically, it was not her problem, stop bothering her. The owner and his family live on premises and occupy one end of the building. Just after checking in we wandered down the back steps, which we realize later are meant only as a fire escape (unmarked in any language). We ended up around the side of the building trying to find our way back to the front and while looking at the mountains were accosted by the owner's other daughter who yelled/ informed us that were in a private area. We apologized and went the other way but she sneered at us every time she saw us afterwards. The rooms were pleasant, but stuffy and really could have used a fan or some sort of ventilation. I know the Italians have a thing about air blowing on them at night--so I'm willing to give them a pass there. Another, small, complaint: The rooms had no blackout curtains. While they do have this amazing metal retractable screen system, when we had it down the room became unbearably hot. The location is out of this world, and so the lousy hotel experience did not ruin our stay. But again, I would stay in Castelrotto, where there are a large number of hotels and restaurants.

The Alpe di Siusi area is breathtaking, peaceful, and as close to """"The Sound Of Music"""" imagery as you're likely to find; And the Alpenhotel Panorama somehow manages to make their hotel experience just as pleasant and memorable. The location is perfectly placed in the middle of the meadows atop one of the highest points of view (thus... panorama) The staff are unbelievably friendly and welcoming - the rooms (at least the one we stayed in) have terrific views overlooking the pristine alpine meadows and are appointed like a 5 star hotel - beautifully designed to integrate with the natural surroundings. There are several easy trails just outside the hotel's front door that meander through amazingly bucolic scenery. With our windows open at night and the silence only broken by the sound of cow bells clanging in the distance... this was an unforgettable experience. We opted for the half-board which included a 6 course meal prepared by a 2 star Michelin Chef - Each night was something different and amazingly delicious! Again, this was one of our most memorable dining experiences in all of Italy. We can't say enough about this hotel. Absolutely fantastic! P.S. If you can, try visiting when the wildflowers are in bloom (mid June - July) The tapestry of color is really quite amazing! Room Tip: top floor - newly built wing See more room tips",family,POS

Staff ALL friendly helpful, and had a sense of humor , important when trying to cope with English and questions . The place is designed for comfort , plenty of activity space for the children , who were there but because they were entertained we re fine This time took advantage of the spa area , excellent and spotlessly clean as was the whole hotel.

It is managed by young family and every year you could see interior enhancements. Apart from tasty food there is a very good and always full pizzeria, and you can choose pizza or regular dinner while in half-board. Both hotel and pizza place are published in Michelin red guide as well.

It's a large hotel with comfortable rooms, an outdoor pool (too cold in September!) and a spa with pool in the basement. Breakfast and dinner were good quality. The staff in the restaurant are very professional and friendly; sadly, the staff on reception are not quite so friendly. There is no Internet access here - not for guests, that is. You should also know that car access to the Alpe di Siusi is very restricted. If you are staying at the hotels (there are a couple of others) you can drive in on your first arrival at any time via Compatsch; you need to show the foresters your reservation. Once there, you cannot drive in or out during the middle part of the day. In fact we drove in on a track from S Cristina, not really realising that this is not strictly allowed! However, there is a frequent bus service to Compatsch. It rained quite a bit during our stay, but the pool and spa gave us something active to do.",family,NEG

We had booked an Deluxe Suite, and the room we got looked a lot different than the pictures. The hotel had done a mistake and instantly upgraded us to Royal Superior. The roof terrace is great, with a seperate wellness area, bar and smooth jazz playing over the outdoor speakers. Since it happened to be UEFA Euro, thay had set up an outdoor TV area, which was great. The only setback on the hotel is that the Wi-Fi system is extremely difficult with bad reception and new log in for each session.

“Highly recommend this hotel!”,"Cannot say enough positive things about this hotel. We stayed here for three nights with our two kids (5+1) in a three-bed room plus a babybed. First of all, we were greeted with a big smile and a handshake by the one owner of the hotel, Helga Zemmer. We were shown our room - which was HUGE. Modern, bright, with a big bathroom. You could close the window shutters and it got totally dark in the room at night - helpful with kids...The room was absolutely quiet, you could not hear anything from the hallway or other rooms. Extremely clean! They have a wellness area which we did not use because of the unusual opening hours only in the afternoon. The kids playroom in the basement was nice and we used it daily, it even had a table-soccer. The five-course dinner was served at 7pm, you should arrive not later than 7:30. It always included a salad buffet, a first course (typically a pasta dish), a soup, a main course (which you decided for at breakfast; a choice between two meat dishes) and a dessert. The meat was from local farms and the dishes were prepared after regional recipes. Only a few dishes were just okay, most of them were delicious. The prices for beverages was high, but typical for the area. Dinner takes a couple of hours here, but the owner gives the guests several opportunities during a stay to meet each other like a pre-dinner cannapes and Prosecco get-together. Breakfast buffet was very good! Different choices of cereal, Muesli, cheeses, cold-cuts, yogurts, breads, rolls, also cake, fruit and hard-boiled eggs. Many tea options and good, strong coffee. The hotel is about a ten-minute walk from the center of Compatsch which has a tiny grocer, places to eat and a few stores. The views from the street-facing side of the hotel are breathtaking. Note that there is little traffic due to the travel-restrictions of the road. You can sit outside in the front in the sun, enjoy a good Latte Macchiato and relax. The two owners of the hotel, the sisters Zemmer, are extremely friendly and helpful. The rest of the staff is very kind as well. Helga even offered my husband a lunch package when she heard he was gonna take a long hike the one day, and that without any extra charge! Wow, is that service or what?

But Goldknopf is the first that can really call the menu """"gourmet"""". We very much enjoyed out stay here. The hotel is located at approx. 2000m. It was very cold and rainy for the first three days of our stay, which meant the hotel was directly in the clouds and it was very wet and misty. On the other hand when the sun is shining and the sky is clear you have the loveliest view over Alpe di Siusi. Also, if you decide to visit Bolzano or any other place you need to keep in mind to leave before 10AM and that you cannot get back before 5PM since Alpe di Siusi is a nature reserve.

For summer vacations the hotel is close to two main hiking trails, so you can easily stay a week with hiking without ever using your car to get to a trail head.

In the winter this place would be heaven for skiers who could ski in and ski out right from the front door. Several hikes of varying difficulty are available without driving anywhere, although the altitude is 7500 feet or so and you need to keep drinking water to avoid headaches and other problems.

Cooking is italian style and probably foreigners appreciate it, but for Italians (like us) the expectation is to taste the food of the region. Dinner takes definitely too long. Not less than two hours for a fixed menu (four courses with no choice). Breakfast could be better (e.g. with home made jams instead of industrially packaged).

“Bad price quality ratio”,"We have been in this hotel in a group of 11 people last year. It was my first bad experience with the hotel in that area after many years of coming to Italian Alps for holidays. I am generally not very picky about hotels I visit but in this particular case I was disturbed by such a low value for a significantly high price. This hotel is a good 3 star hotel and should be priced accordingly but it is not even close to stated 4 stars. Despite early reservation (3 months in advance) the hotel management was unable to provide us the room reserved in the main building with mountain view instead they have gave us the room in annex building with parking view for the same exact price. It was impossible to sleep with open window and very hard to do it with closed one, since local guests were leaving after dinner very late and stuff was coming very early, all happened directly under our balcony. Room was very tiny and not very nice. Hotel management was welcoming and polite but the lack of personnel was obvious. We were waiting for our dinner for 2 hours every day and we had no choice but to cancel further dinners after one evening when they started serving our food the moment other guests were finishing their deserts. I understand that the restaurant is not a fast food, but such slowness was just too much. Not to mention that restaurant stuff started to become irritated and rude after our attempts to fasten the process and claimed that they didn't understand my terrible English. Overall I think that mentioned complaints could have been avoided if the value of this hotel was stated honestly from the very beginning and people who made all those rave reviews would have been more realistic about what they were writing.

The hotel is very comfortable and very clean, boot room, very warm and great ski bus service. The bar staff were friendly, but the restaurant was really disappointing!

“Best experience in Europe over 30 years”,"We stayed in this marvelous hotel for 3 nights after a hectic week in Milano. We have been coming to Europe nearly every year or every other years over the last 30 years (5th time in Italy). Of course this place does not match some of the very expensive hotels we have stayed in Europe, but we had by far the most comfortable, pleasant and enjoyable experience by staying at this hotel. As many reviewers stated, staffs are genuinely nice and service is outstanding. The entire hotel has very calm and friendly atmosphere where you could really, really relax. I did not know anything about this hotel and blindly booked through Booking.com with the help of Tripadvisor. Actually the name sounded too 'American' and I almost avoided this hotel if I did not see such high rating by Tripadvisor's reviewers. Don't be misled by the name. This is a family operated local hotel where most visitors during the summer are from nearby European countries (Austria, France, Germany of course Italy) and can tell they are 'regulars'. The view from the room and from a large deck was breathtaking (see the picture). Breakfast and dinner were outstanding (dinner menu changes everyday). The dinner costs only 25 Euros/person, but the quality is first class and worth well over 50 Euros/person. In fact I spent far more just for a lousy lunch in Milano. Also one day they had a special pasta night in addition to your regular dinner where you can ask a pair of cooks how you want your pasta to be cooked (type of pastas and ingredients) and I had squid, octopus, shrimp, and fish pasta). Local deer stake for dinner was very tasty. One more thing, we originally booked the last room available on Booking.com. The room was small and facing the next building. So I just asked whether any room is available facing valley and beautiful mountains with deck. The receptionist said that there is one and with additional 10 Euro/day we could move there. We took the offer, but to our surprise, the manager (a family member sitting in the back) said we could move there without paying additional fee. The advise I have for tripadvisor readers is that book your room via hotel site not through internet travel sites if you want a fantastic mountain and valley views and sun deck (yes with internet travel sites, rooms may cost you a bit less but you many not get what you want). If you like hiking or biking, trails (just simple walking to advanced hiking and biking) are everywhere starting from the hotel. Finally, hotel room is comfortable and very clean. So if you are looking for a hotel for relaxation and summer activities in this fantastic alpine mountain region near the border between Austria and Italy, this is definitely for you.

“A Wonderful Family Run Hotel”,"We loved this hotel even before we arrived. Unable to fit our snow chains just a few minutes from the hotel we called them and immediately Charlie arrived and within seconds the chains were fitted and we were able to complete our 9 hour drive. This was typical of the service and nothing was ever too much trouble for the Costamoling family and their team. Without exception everybody was warm and friendly. Rosie who looked after us in the restaurant and knew our every whim before us and Michael who was always on hand from choosing one of the brilliant local wines through to picking the right skis for our level of skiing and the conditions - changing them as the conditions changed - that's service! The ski room was well fitted out and less than a minute from the piste which was bliss. The fastest day's skiing was spent following Michael who was a dream guide; we went to Cortina and it seemed everywhere in between, which involved taking a bus as it's not quite seamless skiing and as soon as Michael realised we might have to queue, suddenly fleets of taxis or a bus magically appeared to whisk us on our way. OUr room had fabulous views down across Corvara and the mountains. They were comfortable and spacious, my only gripe would be the some days the towels were a bit threadbare - I'd suggest they don't replace the towels every day but make sure they are better quality. The food was good quality and plentiful - too much if you took advantage of one of the many gorgeous mountain restaurants including their own Punte Trieste which was great fun and excellent food. The wellness centre offered excellent facilities and a very relaxing end to a day's skiing. With the fabulous scenery and skiing we are definitely going to be returning to the Sporthotel.

The breakfast and dinners were amazing. The staff were great and nothing was too much trouble. Even organised for my skis to be tuned in town and they were picked up that afternoon and dropped off ready for use the next morning. The rooms spacious and comfortable.

On a daily basis we enjoyed a full and yummy breakfast, helpful advice to all and any question, a delightful selection of cakes after skiing for afternoon tea, the wellness centre (pool, spas, saunas, steam rooms, etc ), a consistently excellent 5 course dinner, a new herbal tea and cocktail to try at the bar and a very comfortable bed to retire to. The ski room was excellent and the couple of times we went into town to shop,etc, we really appreciated being dropped off and picked up. We also joined in with the ski guiding day which was really fun and provided the opportunity to meet more of the guests. All of us would return in a heartbeat.",friends,POS
“Perfect family holiday”,"Hotel Feldhof is the perfect location for a family holiday - plenty of activities for children, very attentative and personal service, a good variation of sports facilities (pools, bikes...), great food and good wines",family,POS
“brochure pictures are not realistic”,"This hotel was a let down from the minute we drove up. The location is right on the main busy road. We could not sleep with the windows open because the noise from the traffic would was so loud. Especially near 5 in the morning when the supplies were being dropped off. The pool that looks so huge in pictures is not. The pool slide that is highlighted only works for a few hours a day. The children couldn't use it at will, only when it turned on. That is a shame since the weather in that area can change in an instant. When it was sunny the slide was not operational, when it was raining the slide was on. The same applied to the inside pool fountains, they are all on timers and would only work some of the time through the day. The pools are all closed off at 8 in the evening. Far too early for my children. The exercise area, another disappointment, had very few items to use. No dumbells, or free wieghts of any type. The mats and balance balls where locked in another room. You were not allowed to use them unless you were participating in a class. The vetilation in the exercise room was terrible and the smell was disgusting. The bar area, while nice, was not comfortable. The lights are harsh and the bartenders were always bothering you to buy more drinks. You could not sit and enjoy one drink, they expected you to at least have 3 or more, if not they would keep pestering you until you bought another or just got up and left. We called for additional pillows and were told there are not any. The towels were frayed and had strings hanging off them. If it was a regular hotel I would understand, but this was supposed to be a luxury family hotel. I don't know where the luxury was, I certainly didn't see it.",family,NEG
“Nice place”,"To start with, Corvara is a very small town so pretty much every hotel has a good location This one is maybe 10mins walk from the main lift Food is descent, nothin to go crazy on but good enough to get by Staff is nice Pool open 4/7pm, spa also only opens late afternoon So if you are to spend a day there you can't do anything but stay in your room I guess I'd say this place is above the average for Corvara and I guess you get what you pay for But not the best choice",None,NEG
"“Mediocre facilities and service, decent rooms”","Concierge was completely unhelpful, when we got stuck on the mountain due to a snow storm on the way to Corvara. He did not call the emergency also suggested that the roads to get to the hotel were closed, whereas we found out that were opened. The pool is actually cold and always over crowded, no hot tub, no steam room, no hot pool. Sauna needs to be booked 1 day in advance. Had dinner at the restaurant, really average for Italian standards. Room had a problem with the fan at 7am, it took hours before someone came to fix it.",friends,NEG
“Nice hotel but service is really BAD”,"It's a tradition in my family that we spend a few days in Corvara in Badia around Christmas, even now that I am living in another city to study. We usually go to garnis, but this time some friends invited us to join them in Hotel Greif. The place is nice, and the rooms look really good. However, the service is really disappointing. First of all, the restaurant. We ate dinner there, and it was really bad. All dishes are pre-cooked and heated in the microwave, and they are not really appropriate for a 4* hotel. Even worse, our waiter was really bad at his job. He forgot to bring my dinner twice! Almost everyone else in our table had already finished eating, and I still hadn't received my plates! I said nothing the first time (I ate too much appetizers so I was fine anyway), but the second time it happened I got really mad. Two of us didn't receive the first course, so we asked the waiter to bring us our dinner. They didn't. A few minutes after they started serving the second course, and they forgot about us again. We asked again, still more or less politely, to have the first course served. This time the friend of mine was served, and I wasn't. You can immagine how mad I was after this! And all of this, again, in a 4* hotel. Other issue was with the ski room. A friend of mine left her UGG Boots there when she went skiing, and when she came back she couldn't find them anymore. She asked to the director, and she was answered that he couldn't do anything. Later on, they just attached a piece of paper on the door of the ski room stating that """"they don't assume any responsibility for objects left in the ski room"""". Note that the Italian Civil Code clearly states that this has no value, because the hotel is responsible by law for things left in ski rooms. Eventually, that evening she noticed another guest with her boots on. We believe that girl took my friend's UGG boots """"by mistake"""". Third... WiFi. In the last days of 2012, there is no free WiFi in this hotel. You have to pay for it, and a lot! (10€ per day) Worst of all? It works only in the common areas, and not in guest rooms. Seriously: even in 10$/night hotels in a place like Baños del Ecuador I could have free WiFi, last summer.",family,NEG
"“Decent value for money, but not a great place”","We stayed for a week in this hotel, for a ski trip. Upon arrival we were unpleasantly surprised with the welcoming at the reception, since we arrived at around 11am and we were told the room can be ready at 4pm...eventually we got it in about 2 hours, but the initial attitude of the staff was not friendly. Pluses in this hotel: - we liked the room, but be ware of the room you book! we had a superior triple room, which was spacious and nicely furbished, however our friends had a standard room in the old part of the hotel which does not deserve a 4 star rating, it was small and not nice, although recently renovated. - we also liked the wellness area, the pool is large although water rather cold. They also have a small outdoor pool. I have got a massage and a beauty treatment, both were very good. - ski equipment is delivered directly to the hotel from the rental shops they have arrangements with, same at departure, we found this very convenient - seems to be a child friendly hotel, although our child is 10 years old and didn't try the kids club. What we didn't like: - quality of food is at best average, both for breakfast and dinner. There is a kids menu, but we only found out after a couple of days that you actually have to pre-order for the next day, the waiter failed to explain this. The restaurant area is large and crowded, feels a bit like a cantine. - reception and lobby area is rather ugly, with some dated furniture, as opposed to the newer wing, which is much better - you have to pay for various things which in most other 4* hotels come for free: wiFi 30 eur for the week, renting bothrobes, slippers, deposit for additional keys, indoor garage. - location is not close to the ski slopes, there is a shuttle bus which takes you there for free between 8.30-10.30 and back from 2.30-5pm, however it gets crowded at peak hours and you have to wait. A public ski bus goes by in front of the hotel, you have to pay 2 eur for the day. - there is some entertainment but we found it low quality and some shows in the theatre were loud until 11pm or so, we were hearing it in our room. Overall, we didn't feel real customer orientation in this hotel, staff is hard working but you can feel this is not a very well managed hotel, with the customer in mind. Just a little example: we asked for the internet card and asked to put the price on the room bill. This was not ok, then we asked to have the card and we will bring the money in 5 mins, this was also not acceptable, but mostly I was annoyed by the attitude of the receptionist. We found a much better attitude and customer care in smaller hotels, which are family run. This is a quite large hotel and feels like it. All in all, it is not a terrible place, but also not one that we would return to. Room Tip: Choose a room in the new wing, the old part of the hotel doesn't really deserve a 4* rating. It...

"“Close to Meran, charm and elegance in the alps - excellent!”","My husband is from Germany, and was there doing temporary work when he got this recommendation from a colleague. Apparently most folks, if they go to this area, are attracted to the larger town, Meran. Naturns is only a hop, skip, and jump away, and truly awe-inspiring. We hadn't been away in a while, and we were looking for something special. Probably the best thing I can say about this hotel is that it treats you superbly (meeting your every need) in a extra special understated way. You don't even realize the fuss that's happening, you just feel supremely content. A few examples - our first morning there was my husband's birthday. When we got to our breakfast table it was expertly and beautifully covered with hand carved wood chip roses and sprays of silver and gold -- with a bottle of """"sekt"""" chilling next to the table. It turns out that the hotel staff had noted the date from his passport while we checked in the night prior. Also, on the first day of our stay, the menu at our table was in German (a majority of folks there speak German as their first language). Through small talk, the waiter figured (what gave it away, my terrible accent?) that I was from the States. The next morning, without a word, our menu had been switched to an English version - even though my husband is German. They are just thoughtful in every small detail, and in a targeted way, which I find far more effective than other attempts at flamboyant service that misses it's mark. Other key points, charming, beautiful creamy yellow paint, everything fresh and clean. Flowers bursting from every window sill. Most eating is done on the veranda overlooking an large apple orchard just below. The view from the veranda is of the sweeping alps, peaks and valleys, and lush green. Some nights dinner continued into dancing and music (for those that stayed) - we usually took walks after dinner. There are also small nature trails to meander during the day. There is a small to mid -sized pool. The spa there is not luxurious. I don't think it is meant to be. It is charming, on the small side, and staffed by a very pleasant young girl. I like down to earth when visiting spas, and this suited my needs perfectly. Since you're in the alps, the hotel is located on a steep hillside - be prepared to walk down to get to the small downtown with cute and practical shops, and then back up at the end of the day. Downtown isn't large enough to spend a day, again it is a smaller, quieter version of the larger Meran close-by. To end, this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review, and I've been visiting this site for a couple of years. I hope that speaks volumes for this sweet, all inclusive breath of fresh air jewel hidden away in the alps",couple,POS
“The pros and cons of Hotel Greif”,"We just spent 7 nights at Hotel Greif in Corvara. We booked our ski trip a bit late this year so didn't have a lot of options at the time we booked. We had an absolutely fabulous week of skiing but while the Hotel Grief was certainly more than adequate but I probably would not opt to go there again. The pros: -a gorgeous setting with the mountains just behind us, -dear regularly crossing the field just outside our room, -a spacious and clean room with plenty of storage space, -plenty of food - some delicious and some less so, -in floor heating in the bathrooms, -fantastically effective ski boot drying racks (those these were full to overflowing so not everyone's boots got on them), -free shuttle bus, and -the majority of the staff were super hard working and very friendly. The cons: -loud music played each night until around 11pm, -our room was overheated and there was no way to adjust this, -the hotel is located a little ways out of town and while an easy walk most of the time - after a long day of skiing and in ski boots it's just a little too far to walk it with kids and the free shuttle bus filled up quickly and some of the other hotel patrons were insistent at pushing in and so those of us less skilled at the art of pushing in were left behind on a couple of occasions after having been waiting much longer than those who got on -parking under ground was an extra EUR 9 per night -to have a second room key was EUR 5 (surely two rooms keys is standard these days?) -wifi was an extra charge",friends,NEG
"“Excellent Food, Service and Hotel”","Der Weinmesser is a fantastic small full service hotel. The hotel is way up in the hillside overlooking Scena and the valley. The rooms we had were large with balconies and views over the valley, city and mountains, just wonderful! Ask for a room overlooking the valley and ask to have a look at it. This part of Italy is bordering Austria and Switzerland and has been fought over many times, sort of like the Alsace wine region in France. Their main language here is German, with Italian second. Most signs are in German. I found that people love to try out their English and are very helpful. I was told that most tourists here are from Austria, Germany and Switzerland so they do not get a chance to speak much English. The rooms also included breakfast and dinner in the dining room. So much good food. The dinner you have to order at breakfast, you usually have a choice of two main dishes. Their wine selection is fantastic. You will get assigned a table and you will use this for every meal. The hotel sits on the old family vineyard. The word """"Weinmesser"""" goes back a long time to when the local wines were checked for quality by the Weinmesser. Like quality control. The hotel has three different types of saunas a pool and you can get a massage if you so care. All is very clean. Great hiking trails through the orchards. The fruit tree blossom is in April. The staff is super friendly and again, love to speak some English when they can. The only draw back I can see is that the parking is a bit tight, but that is common in Europe.

"“Nice view, otherwise just ok”","The staff is very friendly and the bed is comfortable. The view from the room are of the Meran valley and quite beautiful. our room had a sofa ans small knee high table but no chairs for sitting at the small desk. The desk held the TV and a lamp so there was not enough room for our laptop. Also a shortage of easily accessible electrical outlets, the ones at the desk were occupied and one had a choice of either plugging in the lamp, the TV, or ones electronics. The sauna area is adequate with plenty of room to relax, a couple of showers (nothing special) and a water faucet with glasses. no tea or juices offered. the indoor pool area is beautiful and spacious. the food was ok, one has to make a dinner selection at breakfast. while that used to be fairly common in many european half board hotels, some of the nicer 4 star hotels we have stayed in will let one select from a menu nowadays. the wine is terribly overpriced, euro 11.50 for a sampling size (100 ml) glass of a 2010 vintage that was available in the local grocery store for under 10 euro per bottle! limited variety for appetizer/antipasto dinner or breakfast meats and jams selections - same thing every day. dinner entrees and deserts tasty.",couple,NEG
“Below expectations!”,"We travelled with 3 kids of 5, 6, and 1,5. It was not good holiday like it was in Austria last year due to the following: 1) the adult slope is 40 min drive from the hotel 2) the baby sitting services are extra charge if your baby is 1,5 ( from the words of the owner of the hotel - she said if I do not hire private nanny I should not go skiing) At the end there was a misunderstanding with the nanny services and the hotel charged us the whole extra charge at the rate of 18 euro per hour ( all together additionally around 400 euro) as they could not reach their personnel who confirmed that we do not have to pay for the private nanny. The owner shouted and was not polite at all. 3) kids are not taken to the slope by the hotel personnel like in other Kinderhotels we visited before 4) breakfast menus is rather limited ( they do not make hot porridge, no pancakes, no fried eggs with vegetables, no vegetables itself ( you have the option to cut tomatoes and cucumbers) 5) meals for the dinner were good only twice for the whole stay of 8 days 6) spa zone for Adults do not have separate swimming pool like in the hotels we stayed before 7) I wanted to pour baby milk that was in the restaurant after they finished with the dinner ( the restaurant was still opened around 21:00 and they refused to make. Thanks they gave me normal milk)) 8) never go to this hotel again and do not recommend to go)))",None,NEG

Rooms are cozy and relaxing, with amazing views over the valley. Premises (Spa, kids playground, farm, etc.) are excellent. The activities for the kids are very well organised and managed by professional and dedicated staff. Guests are spoiled by a superb cook and friendly waiters (thank you Vincenzo!).

Food is very nice, five course dinner, lunch and breakfast are good. Because it is a kids-hotel dinner goes very fast (within one hour finished). The quality is very good and for the kids there is a special menu. The weekly bbq with pizza-baking for the kids was favorite of our son. Animation-team are superb and yet again; friendly. It is indeed a family-hotel were children are in the center-point of attention. Generally a good hotel but there are some point of improvement necessary, like the beds and airco in the room would be nice because of the high temperatures in the summer. The hotel is not very cheap (all inclusive) but you get a lot in return for the money spend. Water en lemonade is available all day long, it would be nice if coffee and thee are added for the adults.

“Absolutely Perfect!”,"La Perla was an unexpected piece of true elegance hidden in the magnificent Dolomites. I have travelled the world, and was still impressed by the tiny La Perla.

The rooms are lovely with incredible attention to detail (from the soft wool blankets on the balcony, to the chic lighting in the bathrooms, to the smooth sheets, to the room darkening window shutters). And the food at all the restaurants is lovely. I've never seen a more bountiful and elegant breakfast spread than at La Perla. The Osteria restaurant has a fun atmosphere with delicious local food. and somehow the """"super-fancy"""" gourmet restaurant manages to be over-the-top while not being stuffy.

The food was superb, wine and drinks... too much to choose from (i'm not complaining!) and the ski in - ski out really is just that with excellent services offered all round. We both had spa treatments which were sublime and put you right back on track for another hard day on the slopes. Room was beautiful with a view over the slopes on to the ski lift.

The hotel has two minibuses that run until 11am to drop you at the slopes and you can ski all the way back to it (ski past the Col Alto lift). The skiing was great and the more adventerous can ski round the Sella Ronda.

“A not to be missed hotel”,"I truly enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The hotel staff are very warm and pleasant, the amenities are excellent and well worth it all the way. The food was delicious with a touch of class. The rooms are very clean and state of the art. The hotel is itself has so much history to it. Sylvia, the daughter of the Kostner family, led us on a wonderful hike. She is like dynamite, full of energy and very knowledgeable about the place. Franz, the son of the Kostner family too was very pleasant and gave us a lovely introduction to the history of the hotel, the place and the Ladin culture. They have an excellent sauna area and a Nepal Stube with lots of beautiful paintings and history.I highly recommend staying here and am absolutely sure you will not regret the experience.",friends,POS
“Best hotel ever. Really.”,"I just checked out of the Posta Zirm, and feel compelled to write a review.  I have stayed at many fine hotels, but I honestly think that this is the best hotel experience that I have ever had. The Kostner family has run the hotel since 1908 (the building dates from 1848), but the place has a fresh, clean apperance because it has been perfectly maintained.  The decor is Tyrolean, and is truly charming. We were on the """"demi-pensione"""" plan-- breakfast and dinner were provided. The breakfast buffet amazing in its breadth and quality.  Dinner was excellent, a five course affair; a sophisticated salad/vegetable bar to start, then three courses to be selected from either/or a traditional or a vegetarian menu which changed nightly, and several dessert choices. All of these dishes were creative and delicious. The wine list was interesting and reasonably priced. Our room was beautiful, with a large modern bathroom and very comfortable beds. Most of the rooms had a balcony with flowerbox, overlooking the city center, with amazing mountain views on three sides. The amenities were particularly generous: a pleasant afternoon tea daily, a weekly apertif gathering with prosecco and hot hors d'oeurves passed by the wait staff, a beautiful spa with Finnish sauna (including ice bath), two steamrooms, a large indoor swimming pool-- all gratis. The attention to detail was incredible, from the fine hardware to the fine crust on their housemade farmer's bread. However, the reason I feel so compelled to write this review has very little to do with all of that stuff. It is because of the continual presence of the wonderful third-generation Kostner family; the senior Kostners and their son and daughter, Franz and Sylvia. One or more of them were always around the front desk or the dining room-- they actually live in the hotel.  Sylvia is a mountain guide and leads hikes on the various local trails, also gratis. She is wonderfully pleasant, and explains the local wildflowers, geology, and history in a manner that is both informal and professional. Franz could also only be described as wonderfully pleasant, and is equally generous with his time. He gave our group of travelers an inpromptu lecture on his native Ladin culture and history, then an up-to-date discussion of local and national economics and politics-- for the better part of an hour, as we relaxed with drinks in one of the many attractive lounges. So, the basis for my judgement of this as my favorite hotel ever is the attractive physical plant, the incredible value, and most especially, the pervasive feeling of warmth that the owners and each (literally each) of the staff members provide. The employees are all long-termers, and clearly feel some ownership of the place. I should point out that the Posta Zirm, and essentially the town of Corvara, are first and foremost, ski resorts. Our visit was in the very uncrowded shoulder season of early summer. The rates are cheaper then, so that this luxury hotel came at Holiday Inn prices. I cannot say enough good things about the Posta Zirm. I declare it to be, in Michelin parlance, worth a journey.",None,POS
“One of my favorite hotels on the planet!”,I have visited and hiked in the Dolomites every summer for the last six years and always stay at the Posta Zirm whenever I can. The Tyrolean hospitality is wonderful and the staff exceptional. The breakfast buffet is incredible and the dinners are fantastic. The owners Frans and Silvia make you feel like family and they welcome me back every time. The award-winning wellness spa's is one of the best I have been too and the massages and treatments first class. The rooms are spacious and most have great views of the mountains. Access to the cable car Col Alto is right behind the hotel allowing easy access to hiking trails in the summer and great skiing in the winter. This is an all-round great hotel experience.

“Absolutely brilliant”,"There are many reasons to visit Corvara. Firstly the scenery and the mountain walking is truly magnificent and the flowers in the meadows late June to early July are just stunning. And there is the Posta Zirm Hotel. Everything about this hotel is excellent. I have stayed here twice, each time with a walking group. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the dinners and breakfasts are excellent and the rooms we had very spacious. Then there is the spa, tea and cake at 4-5 pm every day, welcoming drinks - it just goes on. Our group has agreed to come back again in a couple of years time - can't wait.",couple,POS
“Service makes the difference”,"We made a last minute booking, so we didn't know the hotel before. The building is quite old but very clean, our room was not renewed but many others are completely new. It is not direct on the slopes (but there is a shuttle service). What really makes the difference is the service: they called us before dinner to know our arrival time (and we had dinner even if it was late), everybody was really very kind and professional. The waitresses were kind and smiling and food was excellent. A """"four stars level"""" service for very honest price: 66 euros / person, half board with new year's eve dinner included.",couple,POS

“Outstanding hotel”,It's one of best hotels i've ever been. The staf is very friendly and helpful. Food is good and rooms are nice but what really shines there is a SPA with swimming pool and a huge jacuzzi when you can relax after day of skiing looking at outstanding view on nearby mountains. The only flaw might be it's location which is in a small village but it really depends on your personality. I prefer more remote places. Room Tip: Pick one with a view of mountains.

“Highly Recommended”,"My wife, Jill, and I stayed at the Hotel Table the week of February 10, 2012 and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is very clean and well maintained. Our room was perfect. Breakfast was to notch. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is an easy walk to restaurants and shops. There is a ski bus stop across the street from the hotel with buses running every 10 minutes. If you are skiing around the Col Alto area, you can practically ski back to the hotel. A trail from the base of the Col Alto gondola takes you to the hotel parking lot that is just up the street. We had some issues with our rental car the day after we arrived. We learned that you need to have arctic diesel in the tank in very cold weather. It is also good to have all-weather tires, snow tire or chains. The rental car company at the Venice airport did not ask if we were traveling in the mountains when we picked up the car and we “assumed” we had a car that would handle the conditions of the season. They do not use arctic diesel in Venice in the winter. The fuel system froze and the car had to be towed to a repair shop. Avis took care of everything, but we were without the car for a couple of days. Mara and Jugo at the Hotel Table were incredibly helpful. They made phone calls for us and Jugo met the towing company for us so we didn’t have to wait around the hotel. Thank you both again for all of your help. We highly recommend the Hotel Table and will stay there again if we come back to Corvara.",couple,POS
“Wonderful!”,"We stayed at Hotel Table this January and we were so pleased with our stay. Everything was wonderful, the hotel room, the friendly staff, the food, everything! They offer a shuttle service to the main lifts in town which was very good for the tired legs and thighs in the mornings. Their cosy café and fireplace on the same floor, very good athmosphere. We could also ski direct to the hotel when we came from one of main lifts.",couple,POS
“Excellent stay at Gasthof zum Hirschen”,"The hotel is located in a tiny village, the GPS refused to find the spot (hint: set it to 'Unsere Liebe Frau im Walde', and not to 'San Felice'), but in the end we did get there... The place is charming, surrounded by a forest, has its own wonderful restaurant serving local cuisine, family-run, and extremely popular with bikers. Breakfast was good, with a great selection of cheese and cold meats, coffee made to order (not machine-made), and eggs on request (a rarity in Italian hotels, it seems). When we first entered the room, the bed was set as a heart, with (faux)-rose petals spread all over it... :) and a bowl of fruit and bottled water graced the table. The hotel is family run, the owners being extremely friendly and helpful. The building also hosts a Metzgerei, offering a wide selection of locally made porcine goodies among other things. The only partially-negative comment I can make is that the mattresses were a bit on the stiff side, which bothered the both of us.",friends,POS
“Nice and quiet location.”,My wife and I stayed here for 1 night while travelling through Italy. This is a lovely hotel in a very quiet little village. The room was really bright and airy. Breakfast was good with eggs offered in addition to the regular continental fare. Customer service was very relaxed but I think that’s to be expected in little country villages. If you just relax and go at their very friendly pace everything gets done in the end. The staff use of English is pretty good which was great since our German is very poor and Italian is non-existent.,couple,POS
“Better than a 10”,"We spent four nights after Christmas, wanted to see the Dolomites, sightsee, and play in the snow. I can't say enough good things about this hotel, it is family oned and the make you feel like part of the family. The first night we asked if ther were any English language on the TV just to have something to listen to. Instead of getting the usual eye rolling disgusted NO like we usually get, Mirko said he would search his two satelites to see if he could find us something in English and he did, Skynews was on our TV for the entire stay. He was even sorry he couldn't find any more but said he would keep looking. The food, breakfast & dinner included in our package was to die for. Breakfast is a generous european style with everything you need to fill up for the day, we were even given the option of having eggs cooked to order with ham or bacon. A 5 course dinner with options was offered on a menue (ours was in English) every night . If you didn't see anything you wanted to try they offered to make you something else--WOW! I almost felt like I was on a cruise ship but better because we were in the Dolomites.",couple,POS
“A wonderful family alpine hotel ideally located for touring the Southern Tyrol & popular with discerning motorcyclists”,"This is the 2nd year I have stayed at at this friendly well run family chalet hotel located 90 miles north of Lake Garda and not far from the northern Italian towns of Lana, Merano and Bolzano. It is just off the ss238 between the passes of Gampen and Mendola. The hotel is in a small quiet village close to the famous RC church and surrounded by working farms with alpine pastures, pine forests and immaculate chalet style houses. There are well groomed signposted trails for walkers and bikers. At some 1200m elevation the air is clear and cool in summer. Although in Italy, everyone speaks German but the hotel staff are tri-lingual. Some rooms have balconies, some overlook the church - first clock bells start at 6.30am! Beds, linen and ablutions were up to standard. All are clean and tidy with plenty of cupboard space. There is a large gravel car park, cafe and small child friendly play area. In addition there is a well stocked village shop attached to the property. The choice of food for breakfast and dinner is outstanding with fresh home grown ingredients, vegetables, fruit, pasties, breads, eggs, cheeses, meats and deserts. You will put on a few pounds! Everything runs with typical Germanic efficiency but the atmosphere is always polite and friendly, other guests are quiet and respectful. The staff rise at 6am and don't stop until late.

"“Nice hotel if you like some rest, but very old-fashioned”","This hotel has a very old-fashioned entrance hall. It's nice that the managers want to keep the authenticity, but it's actually really old. The bar is situated in this entrance hall which makes it a little less cosy when sitting there since you are watching the entrance door. The bartenders do not know how to prepare a cocktail drink. Do not try it there. The restaurant is ok, but rather for the mass kicthen. The pastas which you can eat during the day on the ski slopes are better and fresher. The breakfast is good, nothing to say there, very complete, fresh fruit salad is really nice. The price of the wines is € 15 - € 19. They are very good. The rooms are a bit old-fashioned too, but are tidy. Towels are changed everyday if you wish so. There is no noise at night, so you can sleep well. The quality of the beds on the other hand is not good, so if you have some back problems or something, you will not like this. The sauna complex in the basement floor has been renewed recently and is really one of the strong selling points of this hotel. It is modern (2 Finnish saunas, a Turkish sauna, relaxing room with led-lighted waterbeds, salt room) and the swimming pool is nice to take a dive after skiing. In the basement next to the saunacomplex there are skiing lockers so this is nice if you want to lock your skis. At night you can rent a place in the garage down the hotel. In the winter this is handy since you can get to the parking lot of the ski station in a warm car. That's €3/night extra. The hotel is situated in Sankt Konstantin, about 5 km away from the ski telecabina of Alpe di Siusi. The hotel as such is more for families, not for young people. There is not much to do. It's a little too quiet. The hotel also does not organise any activities. Only on Wednesday a singer comes by the hotel. He cannot sing that well, but he is a major entertainer. It's a long time ago I have laughed so much. Great night! Thank you, Fausto. So this was my honest opinion about the hotel, both strong points and still to be improved issues.

“great value hotel”,"We were very much pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The good sized spa with swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam room etc was very nice indeed. Perhaps a little too much nudity in the saunas for my (english) liking but the Germans seemed quite at home. The bedroom had a great size balcony. The furniture was a little tired but all very clean. Pillows were awful and he shower screen was also rubbish but these are minor gripes. We had half board and the dinners were really good and quite varied. The breakfast was continental only with no hot options - fairly typical for this part of the world but not ideal for my (English!) mind. The location is decent - although you have to drive for 25 minutes to get to the Sela Ronda (the main slopes) but you can go skiing within 10 mins from the hotel if you want somewhere nearer. Overall it was very nice to stay there and would recommend it. Very good value (c. €130 a night including half board for 2 and spa) and cheaper than other comparable hotels.",couple,POS

Travelling solo to ski in the Dolomites in the early season (December 2011) I had little idea of what to expect. From my first contact by email (which sorted out the travel details that I was struggling with), to the most comfortable, clean and quiet accommodation; excellent dining; relaxing sauna; the bar where guests and locals mingle; and above all the friendly and most helpful staff - Ostaria Posta far exceeded my expectations and made for a great (but too short) holiday.

I never expected anything like what we we were served. The food was amazing. The Chef was the owner and his grandson they used local produce and had a selection of local wines. Each afternoon we were served home made Apple strudel with an Aperitif. Delicious! The fabulous spread at Breakfast certainly prepared us for a day of hiking.

To point out a small negative which I believe could be managed better is that few steps away from the kids playroom there is a smoking room and we could smell the odor in the kids room, especially in the morning when the door of the smoking room were wide open to the hall connecting with kids playroom. As a parent I find this quite unpleasant and unhealthy for the kids and I believe the management could fix this. As for the location, it´s close to Brunico as well as the skiing slopes by car but it is a small village so there is no square where you can stroll for a cafe. Overall we enjoyed our stay.",family,NEG

“Outstanding Wellness Hotel”,"We spent a wellness week at the Lanerhof hotel and were both impressed with the outstanding quality of the logistics, the facilities and the service. I travel all over the world for professional reasons, staying generally in high quality range hotels. But rarely did I find a combination this well balanced when it comes to quality. Very varied food menu prepared with care, style and quality products. Lovely wellness zone of impeccable quality & hygiene. Helpful and friendly staff all around the clock. The hotel is at an excellent location. Quiet and beautiful, yet close enough to towns and interesting places to visit. No doubt that we will be going back.",couple,POS
“Perfect for a relaxing break near the slopes”,After 4 nights stay at Lanerhof I can say that I have been definetely inpressed by this property. The service and the hospitality are on the top!! The food is excellent as well as the wine choice. The hotels is very cosy. The spa-area is organised perfectly. The only thing I was missing - the proper toiletteries at the bathroom and there was not any music or radio channel on TV. I am dreaming to return to this lovely hotel! Complimenti!,couple,POS
“Unfriendly staff in an unremarkable hotel”,"We stayed here for 5 nights as part of a coach party of mainly older, but not infirm, guests. On arrival were were treated as an inconvenience and this continued throughout the stay. The food was variable, ranging from good to very poor. Altho all other dining tables were laid with jugs of tap water at dinner, none of our groups tables were given any. Our table specifically asked for some every single evening. Others were too intimidated to ask. The rooms were very basic, small, dreary and uninviting. The bed uncomfortable and the room hot. Some rooms were joined by a long shared balcony. Doors on to this were the only room ventilation and as they could be accessed freely along the balcony by others, did not feel secure leaving their doors onto it open at night to relieve the heat. One guest asked to borrow a hairdryer, and another, extra pillows (which had been requested on booking) which were eventually given, but not with a good grace. On the plus side, the whole place was very clean and just one (young, male) waiter was pleasant and helpful. If the staff had been pleasant then the other shortcomings would most likely have been overlooked.

“Excellent location”,"This hotel was chosen by the coach company used by myself,husband and two friends on a visit to the Italian Sud Tirol, our main reason for going was to visit the Italian Dolomites. The hotel is centrally situated in a small village. Rooms were clean and tidy and the staff were very friendly. There was a regular bus service which picked up across the road from the hotel. We were on a half board basis and had four courses each evening. It was a set menu starting with a salad bar,second course was soup or pasta, main course was a meat course and finally a dessert. One night food was not included so we ordered from the hotel menu and the steak we had was delicious and the cost was very reasonable. There are lots of well marked walks in the area, many of which start from within 50 mtrs of the hotel. The Sud Tirol is a beautiful area and our visit to the Dolomites was the icing on the cake. Room Tip: Our room at the front had good views but was noisy. See more room tips",friends,POS
“Excellent!”,"It's a family run hotel. When we arrived a man helped us with the luggage. The room was spacious with a big window and a terrace. Generous breakfast consist of big variety of local cheeses and traditional speck and a lot of salami. The coffee was good, freshly made, not instant. When we returned from ski there was always hot soup waiting for us. For dinner we can choose from two different lists of dishes and one of our vegetarian friends had fish dish separately prepared every evening. The food was tasty, fresh made and really more than enough. The spa was excellent and we received a compliment massage. At the check out there was a gift for everyone of us.",friends,POS
“Great place to stay”,"Wonderful personnel, helpful and responsive, though only one person spoke English. In the rest - just about perfect service.

“Great hotel - great memories”,"I had an amazing holiday at Hotel Alpenrast the last time my family and I stayed in Riva di Tures. It is a family run hotel full of charm and personal touches. The family clearly have invested their lives into the place, which is seen in the personal/ friendly customer service. The food is traditional and the meal sizes are more then generous. There were a few days where I just couldn't get through all the meals. The South Tyroleans certainly know how to dine! The rooms are comfy and there is a sauna/spa to soak away the winter cold. Riva di Tures is without a doubt one the most beautiful spots of all the alps. I think of it as a secluded retreat. I enjoyed the endless skiing on offer and the beautiful atmosphere. The locals add to the atmosphere and are a lot of fun, especially around new years. I will definitely be back again soon with the family :) Room Tip: Make sure you ask for a room with a view of the mountains. It is breath taking. See more room tips",family,POS
“Superb Family Owned Hotel”,"Enjoyed a very pleasant stay with friends during a five day Summer walking holiday in the dolomites. The hotel restaurant is very good for both breakfast (buffet style) and dinner and the location is ideal as a base for walking in the area and exploring the Ladin culture. The Ladin museum is nearby and it is well worth a visit. Mr and Mrs Winkler are superb hosts and ensured that our stay was memorable. The room was large with superb views from the balcony. The parking is free and there is free internet. Needless to say, it would also make an ideal base for skiers in Winter. the hotel also has a sauna.",friends,POS

Breakfast was always excellent and Petra was always on hand with plenty of tips and helpful advice. She also has a good sense of humour and makes the feel you are a valued guest.

The room was spacious, clean and comfortable with a gigantic deck. The view from the room was amazing! The entire Dolomite area was reminiscent of the Sound of Music. Castlerotto was a very charming and quaint town. We went for a number of beautiful walks. The town center is lovely. I also enjoyed a sunrise walk along the road that Haus Silbernagl is on. It turns into beautiful meadows. I also highly recommend a hike and or ski lift in the Alp di Susi, which is a short drive or bus ride away. Haus Silbernagl was exactly what we needed on a long trip through northern Italy! We hope to return soon and often.",couple,POS

“Splendor in the Dolomites!”,"We are really fussy about where we stay (cleanliness, attractiveness, location, parking, need for non-allergenic bedding, and a great value:price ratio). This B&B met all of our requirements, and then some. In all respects, this is one of the finest B&Bs you will find, anywhere! We stayed at the Haus Silbergnagl in the Spring of 2009 and were thrilled to be able to return again this year, 2010. On every criteria, especially the friendliness and helpfulness of our hosts, Petra and Enzo, you it is an extremely attractive and super-clean B&B. It's really special. The view from our room was stunning. We could look out over the vast green valley to the mountains and out of another window, we enjoyed the view of the towering magnificence of the Dolomites. Breakfast was always great. A main dish is made to order and there is a great selection of cereals, fresh fruit, juices, and other breakfast foods on a self-service buffet. Coffee is served at the table. The quality of food is outstanding. The comfort of the room -- and bed -- is first-rate. Parking is on the property, and could not be easier. There's an easy walk to restaurants and stores (we especially liked Toni's Italian restaurant). And access to the highway was a breeze. The town, itself, is charming. It is quintessentially Tyrolean. And now, the piece de resistance: The indoor pool and sauna just a few steps below the breakfast room. It is perfectly heated, perfectly sized, and even has a resistance feature for those who want a challenge. We used it last year (had it all to ourselves) and it was the most relaxing hour we can remember. This year (shame on us) we didn't save time for it as we spent every day driving the Dolomites! Writing this, we wish we were in that pool now (and we have one of our own right outside). Given all this luxury, one could easily imagine they were staying at a 5-star hotel. But this B&B offers all that PLUS -- at a very reasonable rate. We look forward to coming back again and again to enjoy more nights at this wonderful B&B. We are confident you will find it as pleasureful and memorable as we have!",couple,POS
“Best place I stayed in Italy”,"Haus Silbernagl was definitely the best place I stayed during my four weeks in Italy. The hotel is very clean, and the rooms are a good size. I had an amazing view from my balcony of the Dolomites. I didn't even have a reservation when I showed up, and Petra, the wonderful hostess, accommodated me for 3 nights. I felt like staying more! The place is so quiet, it was the best sleep I had had in months. The breakfast was far better than anything else I had in Italy. Fresh eggs, juice, yogurt, cereal, breads, meats, cheeses! Petra gave good recommendations of places to eat and hike. I will definitely come back!",None,POS
“Stay here.”,"We chose this B&B based on its excellent reviews, and it did not disappoint.

We highly recommend this B&B and will certainly stay here when we return to the Tyrol.",couple,POS

The rooms are very clean and comfortable, large bathrooms, great view, wifi - what more could you want? Petra also surprised us with the spectacular breakfast she served up every morning. Her recommendations for hikes and places to eat were spot on. We planned to stay one night and ended up staying 3 because we liked it so much. This is one of the best places you will ever stay at.",couple,POS
“Great B&B - Wonderful Location and Host”,"We stayed at the Haus Silbernagl for two nights in May. This ended up being one of our favorite inns from our trip, and I would highly recommend it. The inn is located in Castelrotto which is a great jumping-off point for outdoor activities in the Dolomites. We were obviously there in the summer, but it looked like a great ski resort area for winter travelers as well. Our room had a view of the mountains and a balcony, which I would recommend. The room was good-sized with comfortable beds. It also had a nice-sized bathroom. Everything was super clean and the home/gardens were obviously taken very good care of. The inn also has an indoor pool which we did not use while we were there, but it looked nice. The breakfast had a nice variety of foods - yogurt, cereals, granola, meats, cheeses, and fruit. Eggs are also made fresh if you would like them. The breakfast room is very cheerful and nice. She also has wine, soda, etc. available in her fridge on the """"honor system"""" basis for a reasonable price if you want to relax in the evening. The hotel is located just a block or two away from the town square, so it is very convenient for walking to dinner, picking items up at the grocery store, etc. There is a good amount of parking available at the inn if you drive there. Petra is an amazing host and we really enjoyed talking with her. She had a lot of good ideas and tips about which hikes were good and other activities in the area. We hiked in the Alpi de Suisi and would highly recommend that area to anyone looking to explore the Dolomites. The price was also quite reasonable, although we were there in the off season.",couple,POS
"“great guesthouse and host,wonderful location in the dolomites”","My wife and I spent 3 wonderful days exploring the Dolomites by car and foot using the Haus Silbernagl in Castelrotta, Sud Tirol, as our home base, a decision we came to appreciate more each day. Castelrotto is a very old town at the base of the Alpe di Siusi,a high meadow surrounded by mountains, with cable cars used for skiing in winter and hiking in summer. Our garni, like others in town, was a solidly built Tyrolean ski lodge. Our large top-floor room had a balcony with sliding glass doors and a great view of the Dolomite Mountains. Both the bedroom and the bathroom were spotless and thoroughly modern. Our very friendly host/owner Petra gave us considerable information about her home town area and also recommended 2 very good but relatively inexpensive restaurants that we enjoyed a great deal. A very filling buffet breakfast was offered each morning, including fruit, pastries, meat and cheese cold cuts – all this for 75 euros per day. We are recommending the Haus Silbernagl to our friends, and we plan to stay there again when we next visit the Dolomite region.",couple,POS
“Highly Recommended”,"South Tirol is a wonderful place to visit and this guesthouse is the place to stay. It's centrally located, within easy driving distance of the major attractions/towns, and a 15-minute drive from the Alpe di Siusi, the best hiking are in the Dolomites. The town of Castelrotto is quintessential Tirolian. As for the the guesthouse itself, it's location within the town is ideal. It's in a quiet area, but within a 5-minute walk are the main square, 5 good restaurants, and a grocery store. Petra is a wonderful host and the whole house is clean and comfortable, with good-sized rooms. The buffet breakfast was very good, with a nice selection of both hot and cold items, and more than enough to fuel the body for a day of hiking. And it comes with a solarium and indoor swimming pool if the weather doesn't cooperate! All this at a VERY reasonable price. If I'm ever back in that area again, I will definitely be staying here.",None,POS
“Wonderful B&B in Castelrotto/Kastelruth”,"First, let me start off by saying the host, Petra, couldn't be more friendly and accommodating. We were traveling with our 1 year old daughter and Petra insisted they clean/sanitize her bottles which they did each morning. The location is perfect and our top floor, spacious room afforded us a great view of the Dolomites. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was spacious too. It was very easy to relax at Haus Silbernagl! Haus Silbernagl is conveniently located if you wanted to walk a short distance into Castelrotto's city center or one can start their treks/hikes right from Petra's place one one of the numerous trails in the area. Petra is a subject matter expert on where to go and what to do and knows the trails extremely well. We highly recommend Haus Silbernagl if you're headed to the Dolomites. The only reason we cannot give our stay 5 out of 5 is because of the steep wireless internet fee and the breakfast. Outside of the eggs made to order, the breakfast was very average compared to other B&Bs we've stayed at in the past throughout Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy. Although the breakfast was somewhat disappointing, Petra is one of the best hosts we've ever come across. Room Tip: Ask for the top floor! See more room tips",family,POS
“Great place to stay and explore the countryside.”,We had seven wonderful days staying at Haus Silbernagl in May 2012. As others have indicated Petra is full of local knowledge and helpful advice about the best walks for differing weather conditions. We had a spacious room on the upper level with views to the mountains. We particularly enjoyed walking in the Suis de Siusi area. If you are travelling by public transport it may be worthwhile getting a Bolzano card which gives access to museums and the transport system including travel from Bolen/Bolzano to Castelrotto/Kastelruth and beyond. We purchased a 7 day card and used it to visit a number of Museums including the Iceman exhibit. We also used it to ride the cable car and train above Bolzano as well as traveling around the area on the bus system so we really found it excellent value. At the time of our visit the cable cars were not running so we also used the bus to access the start of the more elevated walking routes. The restricted internet access (relatively expensive time charging) may be a negative for international travellers but I think Petra might be reviewing this for next season.

"“He says German, I say Italian”","Castelrotto is a lovely town in the Dolomites in Italy in a beautiful area where all the towns are named in both German and Italian. This made for an interesting stay since my husband is part German and I am 100% Italian. There we stayed at Haus Silbernagl where we had the best time out of the 10 places we visited in the Alps! It was a gorgeous location with a delicious breakfast consisting of a buffet and eggs to order. Petra, our hostess, was at breakfast daily to visit and to go from table to table answering questions in German, Italian, English, and we think French also. She would help with problems and give suggestions for daily hikes and adventures with maps she provided to help. Our room was spacious and beautiful with a double sink in the WC and a balcony with a gorgeous view. There was a heated indoor pool, free parking, and lovely landscaped gardens with chaises and beautiful flowers and trees where you could relax. It was in a great location...you'd be in town in about 5 minutes or less. One night she recommended a fabulous restaurant where I had the best Cordon Bleu in my life and my husband bragged about his delicious steak.

“I want to go back!”,"What can you say about Haus Silbernagl and its hostess, Petra---not enough! We were only in Castelrotto for 2 days, and it rained all day on one of the days, and we still loved it. Petra reminded me a of young Carol Channing (in a good way!). She met us at the door of her beautiful home, and the hospitality never stopped. After a tour of the house (including the indoor swimming pool), she pointed out walking trails along the Alpe di Siusi that she thought we might like and other places that she thought we would enjoy. She also had good recommendations for restaurants. We had a room on the top floor, quite a few stairs for the non-hardy, but worth it for the beautiful Dolomite views out of both windows. The room itself was spacious with a balcony. Breakfast was very pleasant with a small buffet and some of Petra's homemade jams and marmalades. Petra also had a refrigerator set up with wine, beer and other beverages that guests could pick up at any time. All that was required was signing your name for future billing. As I mentioned we had one very rainy day that was totally unsuited for sightseeing or hiking. We chose to use it as an R & R day and read in the small lounge area and only ventured out for meals. I had planned to use the pool, but was so comfortable reading that I never got around to it. Petra may be Castelrotto's biggest cheerleader. She clearly loves her house and the area, and it shows. Haus Silbernagl will not be forgotten.",couple,POS

Our room consisted of 2 bedrooms one with double bed and other with 2 twin beds plus 2 large bathrooms and large wrap around balacony with great views.

During our breakfast Petra explained about the procession happening on the 1st Sunday of the month and some other interesting facts about Castelrotto! Petra gave us great information about hiking in Alpe di Siusi and how to get to Compatch. Unfortunately the area was foggy during our hike yet it was still enjoyable. We ended up rushing/running through the last 30 minutes of our hike to get a glimpse of the procession in Castelrotto. Also, i forgot to mention that Petra has water, juice, beer, wine & a few other items available for purchase at a good price. It may save you a trip to the grocery store before a hike!

Everything is spotless and Petra is a charming and engaging hostess. She provides a wealth of information for hikes in the Alpe di Suisi and surrounding area. Breakfast area is bright and cheerful. We did not use the pool so cannot comment on that feature. The minor negatives would be the hard pillows and the breakfast assortment. It was exactly the same every morning, and after 7 mornings, gets quite monotonous. The town of Castelrotto is picture-perfect and the bus transportation is great.

“Haus Silbernagl is a keeper!”,"We have traveled all over Europe, and always look in Tripadvisor for advice. The rare Tripadvisor five-star rating of Haus Silbernagl is well-deserved. It has the personal service of a B&B combined with a few hotel-only perks (pool, sauna in winter). Petra takes time to listen to your tastes and advise you on the best hikes. Breakfast variety and quality is superb. The Dolomites in sunny weather are heaven-on-earth. You should visit if you have a chance and I wholeheartedly recommend Haus Silbernagl. You'll be glad you did.",couple,POS
“Look no further...This is the place to stay!”,"Please consider staying at Garni Silbernagl. It was the best lodging we had during our 2 weeks in north Italy. The house is located just south of the town center. Our room and bathroom were so large. Our private wrap around balcony offered beautiful views of the Dolomites and town center. Relax your muscles after your hiking in the indoor pool! Petra, the owner, is so kind and helpful. She spent so much time chatting with us and made us feel at home. German is the first language here, but Petra does a great job with English. The breakfast included eggs to order which was something we never found in Italy. Every one of Petra's recommendations was outstanding: Liftstuberl Restaurant had such excellent meals we had to return a few times (a short walk away)We spent 3 nights in Castelrotto - Kastelruth: 16-19 September 2008. The weather was mostly sunny with highs in the 60's- 70's and only a little colder in Alpe de Siusi. I recommend dressing in layers. We purchased gloves and hats in town before going up to Compatsch thinking it was going to be much colder. We didn't need them at all and had to shed our layers into our day packs. We had incredible views while hiking the trails and horseback riding on a clear day. Three nights was perfect. I would also recommend going to Bachler Restaurant in the evening for live music (join the locals as they really have a great time singing along), fresh pretzels at Trocker's Bakery in addition to all of Rick Steve's recommendations. I would highly recommend a visit here. These four days of relaxation and a slower pace was the highlight of our 2 week vacation that also included Venice, Padua and Verona. We are going back for certain. Room Tip: Speak with Petra about your specific room needs she set us up in two connected rooms that was perfec... See more room tips",family,POS
“Great B&B in Castelrotto”,"We sincerely enjoyed our stay at Garni Silbernagl -- especially our warm and energetic hostess, Petra. Our clean, comfortable and large room had a nice balcony, with view of the town and Dolomites. Breakfast was lovely and refreshments were available for the guests at all times. We will definitely return to Garni Silbernagl on our next trip to the Dolomites.",couple,POS
"“Really a home away from home, but much closer to Paradise . . .”","Petra, the hostess, presides at the daily sumptuous breakfast and dispenses invaluable advice in three language. The rooms are dlightful, most of them have large terraces with knockout views of the green meadows and craggy Dolomitic peaks in the distance. Coming back from a long hike you are grateful for the swimming pool, the sauna, and the sun terrace. 46 euros a night in July, including breakfast. There are cheaper places, but this is my choice. Love those eiderdowns!!!",family,POS
“Enjoy a very different view of Italy in Castelrotto....”,"We took the train from Lake Como to Bolzano and then a bus into Castelrotto. Enjoyed the adventure on public transportation. Arrived late in the day--much of Castelrotto had already closed up for the evening. But we were welcomed to this lovely bed and breakfast by Petra and her husband who carried our luggage to our room. Plenty of variety of breakfast food, clean, nicely decorated rooms, lovely pine paneled walls and ceilings. Quiet and comfortable. View of the Dolomites from our balcony...which Petra said so sweetly....was """"free."""" I researched a great deal before selecting all hotels on this trip and every single hotel was exactly as expected...or better. My only concern was...there is no discount for people traveling together. We paid the same price per person as a person in a single room. Had I known that, I would have preferred my own room at this point in our journey. It would have been an opportunity to have some alone time. So, since the price is the same for a single room (per person) as a double room (per person) I would have rather slept alone and had my very own space. So if you are traveling with others...there is no reason to stay in the same room unless you want to because the price is the same (per person) whether you are traveling singly or doubly. This was my 2nd visit to Castelrotto (day trip only in 2007) and I wanted to come back and stay in this quaint German town and show this """"different type of Italy"""" to my friend. The setting is peaceful and beautiful. We took the gondola to Alpe di Suissi and hiked around the meadow. Each portion of our 17-day self-directed tour of Northern Italy was perfect. For some reason the roads leading into Castelrotto bother me because of the very steep drop-offs on the side of the road. My traveling companion loved the views and took many pictures on the way up and down, but I had to hide my eyes most of the time. We stayed two nights here and that was plenty for our needs. However, if you do wish to do a lot of hiking, there are many, many trails at Alpe di Suissi to explore and this is a perfect location to rest each evening. One other note...large pool at this hotel. But it closes at 7pm for family use only from 7pm on. When you are hiking Alpe di Suissu, you often don't return until later.. making the pool off limits if one returns after guest usage hours have ended. Seems like it might be nice to have the guest hours last a bit longer so they could use the pool after hiking. Just a thought.",couple,POS
“Friendly guest house”,"We spent three nights in Castelrotto at the Haus Silbernagl, as part of a Dolomites walking trip. It is very well run, clean and comfortable, with an indoor pool, close to the town centre. The owner Petra was very helpful with really good advice about walking locally, and we had two superb walks as a result of her guidance. The room was clean and comfortable with a balcony and excellent view, breakfasts were good too.",couple,POS
"“Lovely place, sure to return!”","Haus Silbernagl was a wonderful stop on our 15 day European tour. We (2 adults, 2 kids ages 9 &12) stayed in the family room and enjoyed having 2 full baths, a separate bedroom for the kids with 2 beds and a huge wrap-around porch. We had an amazing view of the mountains from right outside our window. It's a steep walk uphill from the bus stop (from Bolzano), but not too far. Petra (great hostess) referred us to a wonderful family-friendly restaurant further up the hill for dinner (Liftstueberl) and it was very good. She also gave us excellent advise for our time-limited hike in the Dolomites and we only wish we could have extended our stay.",family,POS
"“Great value, great accomodations, great breakfast, great host!”","My husband and I stayed at Haus Silbernagl based on the reviews we saw on Tripadvisor. It did not dissappoint, in fact, Haus Silbernagl exceeded our high expectations. The town is quaint, the Haus is beautiful and Petra is a very hard working and accomodating hostess. She spent time with us showing us the accomodations, gave us wonderful sightseeing advise and eating recommendations. Her breakfast was delicious and started our days perfectly. Our only regret is that we did not stay longer. Thank you so much Petra!",couple,POS
“A Room with a Spectacular View”,"Unfortunately we only had 3 days to spend at Haus Silbernagl. Petra was so hospitable, helpful, friendly and made us feel like family. Our room was clean, neat and large...a room for my husband and me with a separate connecting room for our teenage son. The view from our room was absolutely breathtaking. We had breakfast in a delightful dining room where we enjoyed an assortment of cereals, pastries, meats, cheeses, and breads along with juices and coffee. The gardens were tended by Enzo....Petra's husband. The gardens were brilliant with color and a variety of flowers and trees. We highly recommend this wonderful hotel. It is indeed a true gem of the Dolomiti and we look forward to returning to this wonderful treasure.",family,POS
"“Well run, comfortable B&B”","We stayed here last summer four nights to explore the hiking trails in the area with our six year old son. Haus Silbernagl is a well run, very clean and comfortable place to make a home base. Petra is am engaging hostess and takes good care of her guests. She knows the area so well and had excellent suggestions for hikes and other activities and sites. The breakfasts have something for everyone--probably the best variety and selection of food at B&B's on our trip. We stayed in a top floor room with lovely views from the balcony each morning, and could watch lightening storms over the mountains at night. The only negative would be that last summer was a heat wave and there was not air conditioning, otherwise the room and beds were very comfortable. Our son told us he wanted to live at Haus Silbernagl!",family,POS
“Wonderful experience!!!”,"First of all, I just can't say enough about this hotel and it's owner, Petra. She and her daughter, Linda and her mother make this hotel very special. When my daughter and I arrived, we discovered that Petra had put us in a corner room with a large balcony and 2 bedrooms. The wood paneling and the furnishings were a nice Tyrolean touch. Hard to believe that we are still in Italy. The down comforter made getting a good nights sleep easy. The hotel is very quiet. The next morning Petra showed us to our table for our home cooked breakfast of bacon and eggs, yogurt, juice, toast and jelly and coffee. There were other choices, cereals and coffee cakes. After breakfast, Petra gave us instructions about what trails to hike in the Alpe de Siusi. Her advice was perfect both days. Another nice feature of this hotel is the pool. It's in the basement of the hotel. One end is glass so the area is bright and cheery. It has lovely murals on the walls, nice lounge chairs and changing rooms. It was a great way to relax after hiking all day. We felt like we were in a resort and we had the pool to ourselves. Petra's recommendation for dinner was very good. I think the name was Leifstuben. It's up the hill. I'm sure only the locals would know about it, since it's not in the heart of the town. The hotel is centrally located and the town of Castelrotto is darling. Do not hesitate to stay here. The reviews are very accurate. Petra, you made our stay very special. We'll recommend the Garni Silbernagl to all our friends who are traveling in the area.",None,POS
“Haus Silbernagle was marvelous”,"My daughter and son-in-law along with my wife and myself spent three fun filled days in the Castlerotto area. The biggest bonus was being able to stay at Petra's guest house. It was very clean and well run. Petra was on top of everything. She gave us very good suggestions as where to visit and helped us plan our days. The breakfast was delightful and well managed by Petra. The only guest house I have ever had eggs prepared how ever I wanted them. The help were all friendly and did an outstanding job of keeping the rooms in order. I would love to spend more time in the area, such beauty and lovely, friendly people. If one is looking for a jumping off point in the Dolomites, go no farther than Castleroto and Petra's Haus Silbernagle, you won't beat it anywhere.",family,POS
“Fluffy down comforters in a pristine Alpine B&B”,"Just returned from a 15 day trip to Northern Italy. Of all the places we stayed, the best bang for our hotel buck was Haus Silbernagl in Castelrotto. It is a picture-perfect, wuaint B&B located in a beautifully-situated alpine town. The innkeeper, Petra, is knowledgeable and friendly. She greeted us every morning in the breakfast room to offer suggestions for exploring the area based on our preferences. My friend and I wanted light hiking, not too strenuous. She pointed us to the Alpe Di Suisi for the best variety of hiking trails and scenery. She was right on the mark! After a long day of walking/hiking and exploring we got into our respective beds and covered ourselves with the fluffy down comforters and pillows and drifted off to sleep. Aahh...",friends,POS
“Accommodation great; Petra greatest”,"We were ten-we grandparents, two sons and their families-children ages 5-14. We spent a week with Petra. The house itself, the rooms, the pool, the honor system bar, proximity to town...it was all anyone could want...clean, modern, wonderful views, comfortable places to sit and read inside and out, good water pressure, maybe a littel too much chlorine in the swimming pool. But the feature that makes it a five star choice is Petra...I think the most helpful, energetic host I have encountered. Every morning at breakfast she came to our table of ten and we sorted through the options for the day, with her having """"spot on"""" suggestions, all done with great good humor. We celebrated our 14 year olds b'day while in the Dolomites. There was a perfect small present at her place from Petra. Suggestions for dinners-ask Petra. Suggestion for b'day party dinner and cake-ask Petra. She never steered us wrong. Enthusiastic thumbs up for Haus Silbernagl and Petra.",family,POS
“Wonderful host!”,"We just returned from a 10 day trip to Northern Italy, and by far our best experience was in Castelrotto and Haus Silbernagle! Petra is the perfect hostess! She greeted us upon our arrival, gave us a tour of her quaint B&B, and answered all our questions. Breakfast was the best to be found in Italy where a croissant and coffee are typical. Not at Haus Silbernagl! Breakfast consisted of fresh breads, yogurt, fruit, cereal, cold cuts, cheese, and coffee. A perfect way to start off a day of hiking in the Dolomites. We hope to return someday to experience winter and skiing, and will without a doubt stay with Petra in her beautiful home!",friends,POS
“An absolute gem!”,The village of Castelrotto is spectacular and there is no place better to enjoy it than while staying at Haus Silbernagl. Our room was spacious including a balcony with doors opening onto a beautiful view of the mountains. Petra is a wonderful hostess and because we were only staying one night; she promised not to rub salt in our wounds by telling us how much there is to do around Castelrotto (and therefore how much we'd miss!). We will definitely be back and we'll definitely stay at Haus Silbernagl. Pete and Cath,couple,POS
“Excellent pension and location”,"The rave reviews of this guesthouse seem to be all true. The room we were in was spacious, the location in a lovely mountain village perfect for travelling, and the knowledge of Frau Silbernagl very useful. We want to come back, if possible tomorrow.",family,POS
“Perfect location/hotel for the Dolomites”,"My wife & I stayed here for 4 nights in early June. It was the off season, so a lot of places and lifts were closed or inaccessible. However, the area is so beautiful it didn't matter. Castelrotto is an ideal town to stay. In fact, if we did this trip again, we'd still stay in Castelrotto and at Haus Silbernagl. It's very central - go one direction and you are at Alpe de Suisse (highest alpine meadow.. a wonderful walk), go the other and there is Pordoi Pass and Marmolada. The inn is run by Petra, who is also one of the nicest people we've ever met. She helped us plan our day each morning while we ate a wonderful breakfast - the eggs and ham were fantastic. This isn't your average B&B fare. Also, the beds were very comfortable and we had a nice little deck to sit out on on the evenings while we drank some local wine. I can't recommend enough. The only issue I had was that there wasn't free wifi - you could pay for an hour or two, but it was a bit much. However.... you are in the Dolomites. You shouldn't be dying to check our email/facebook anyhow :-)",couple,POS
“The Best Hostess”,"The only complaint we had about Haus Silbernagl was that we didn't stay long enough. Petra is a delight. She was so welcoming and helpful, her breakfasts were fantastic, and she made our trip to Castelrotto feel like we were coming home. Haus Silbernagl is spotless and so homey. It is located in town, a quick walk to restaurants and the city center. We can't wait to return next summer!",friends,POS
“I want to go back!”,"My daughter and I stayed two nights at Haus Silbernagl, and I wish it had been longer! This is definitely one place I want to go back to! Petra was an excellent host. She gave us a map and recommended several hikes. Our room was fantastic, with a fantastic view from the balcony. The beds had down comforters and were the most comfortable beds we slept in during our stay in Italy. The breakfast was very good, with lots of variety--and good coffee. I have nothing but good to say about our stay. I would love to be able to go back some day! Thank you, Petra!",family,POS
“Big Wow Factor”,"After spending four days at Haus Silbernagl all I can say is WOW! What a nice place! Bottom line up front, we will definitely be back here again and again. First thing about this place is that you get the feeling that you're staying with family. The owner, Petra, helped us with our bags to our room, gave us a tour of the hotel and facilities, and then sat down with us for a while helping us map our strategy for the weekend. In addition, every morning at breakfast she would ask us about our day and give us great recommendations. And then there's the rooms. We had a big family room which had a huge L-shaped balcony that overlooked both the old city and the mountains. At night, after a long day slogging up and down the Dolomites, we would sit there and watch dusk settle on the town amidst the tolling of bells...just magical. The room itself was great....spacious, uber-clean, comfortable, just toss in any positive adjective you can think of. In closing, you cannot go wrong if you stay in this place.

“Loved it here”,We booked with some confidence after reading excellent reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. We arrived early but were greeted warmly by Petra and shown to our excellent room. This had a large balcony and faced the mountains. Beautiful. Breakfast was the traditional Northern Italian offering and was plentiful and Petra would sit with you and offer advice on what to do for that day. It is an excellent base for exploring the numerous mountain passes and Castleruth itself is a lovely little town. Haus Silbernagl is well kept and Petra is an excellent host. The only downside are the churchbells which ring out from early morning but Petra cannot do anything about that!!,couple,POS
“wonderful experience”,"We recently stayed at Petra's beautiful bed and breakfast. It is immaculately clean, the breakfast is bountiful, and the location is just a few minutes walk to town. There is free parking also. We had a room with a balcony that looked out over the mountains and Petra was super friendly and helpful with guiding us as to what and where to sight see in the area. Her home also has a lovely indoor swimming pool.",couple,POS
"“Great Small Hotel, Helpful Owner”","My husband and I spent three nights at Haus Silbernagl in September, and were pleased to find that all the wonderful reviews were true. If you are looking for a great, family run, small hotel located a few blocks above the main square in Castelrotto, this is it. Clean comfortable room and bath, pleasant balcony view, pool and relaxing area, good breakfast with eggs cooked to order - it is all there. And, it comes with a great bonus! Petra, the owner, possesses a wealth of information about the area and spent a good amount of time with us at breakfast each morning, inquiring about our plans for the day, and providing helpful advice. We had come to Castelrotto to walk in the beautiful Alpe di Siusi, and she listened to what we wanted to do, and gave us suggestions on a map for two day hikes that suited us well. I've found that when traveling on your own, it can sometimes be a time consuming challenge to figure out all the logistics of what you want to do each day. Truthfully, Petra's advice helped make our days in Castelrotto some of the easiest and most relaxing of our trip.",couple,POS
“sound of music experience”,"WOW, and so much more!! Our adventure began in Bolzano. We boarded the bus and immediately found ourselves surrounded in the beauty of the Dolomites. Our journey ended in the picture perfect, high alpine village of Castelrotto. After a short walk, we found Haus Silbernagl! We were enchanted from first glance and it only got better and better. Petra is the absolute host, wonderful in every way. Being native to Castelrotto, we so appreciated her advice on hiking The Alpe Di Suisi. Breakfast was the best we had in Italy. The view from our amazingly comfortable room was a show stopper! To sit on our private deck with a glass of wine after a day of hiking and take in the view, was heaven! We stayed 3 nights and wished it could have been much longer! Room Tip: i believe every room is amazing with their own views. We stayed on the second floor and loved it.

We would definitely recommend staying here. Thank you Petra!",None,POS
“Best hotel stay of our trip!”,"We stayed for 3 nights at Haus Silbernagl and it was a spectacular experience. First and foremost, let me say that Petra was an amazing hostess - knowledgeable about the region and the trails, thoughtful, and kind! The breakfast was amazing, the yogurt was the best we had in all of Italy. The view from our room was breathtaking; it was nice to view the sunrise and sunset behind the mountains every morning from our porch. The hotel and rooms are immaculately clean. The location is ideal for visiting town as well as accessing any of the trails via foot or bus. Highly recommend!",friends,POS
“Highly recommended”,"We spent two weeks in the Berghotel in Sexten-Moos in July 2012 and where very happy with our stay, we would certainly recommend this hotel. The family and staff running the hotel are really friendly and customer oriented, friendly and clear mails are sent upfront, even supplying us with route suggestions and traffic information without having asked for it. Everyone in the hotel speaks both German and Italian, which was handy as our Italian is limited to ciao and a few other classics, they even remembered which language to address us in throughout the stay. The promise to offer an indoor parking space to all guests was delivered, a brand new indoor garage just across the street offers sufficient space for all cars of guests to get parked in a secure way. We stayed in a studio in the residence. The 65 square meter studio was really spacious with two nice bedrooms, one on the ground floor and one upstairs which was well appreciated by our 15 year old son, a kitchenette where we only used the fridge but which allows to do your own cooking if you wish, a dining table with 4 chairs and a small couch, two nice balconies perfect to dry walking clothes at the end of the day. The residence is connected with the main building through an indoor corridor which is nice when the weather is rainy and chill. We booked a half board formula during our stay and highly appreciated it. The food is excellent. Breakfast offers a great choice in juices, cereals, bread, coffee and tea, several fresh fruits (strawberries, cherries, melon, pineapple, ...), cheese, yoghourt, ... At least 5 choices of honey are offered which was a party for our honey addicted son. A warm buffet also offers eggs in several shapes and a cook is present to prepare your omelet exactly as you prefer it. Diner was also excellent with 5 courses and for each one either a buffet choice or a choice of three to choose from the day before. A lovely mixture of the best of both worlds, the Austrian and the Italian cuisine. Only minus was that when a buffet was offered the choice was sometimes quite limited if you’d arrive rather late for dinner as we usually did and most guests had already passed by the buffet. Wellness facilities are great, a nice indoor and a small outdoor pool, both heated. Several sauna’s are available and most of the time there weren’t too many people present so that was nice and quiet as it is supposed to be. There is also a large whirlpool available outside which offers a great view, it would be even nicer if a hedge or something would hide this a bit from the view of all the hotel room balconies ... WI-FI is available for free which is great, only unfortunately the signal is weak in lots of positions. We only received a good signal in our studio in the ground floor bedroom and on the 7th step of the stairs (-: . It would be nice if the signal could easily be received everywhere on the site, there appear to be lots of routers available but something makes the signal to come out to weak. Also the location is practical, really quiet area, not a lot of traffic passing by, a bakery and a small supermarket are available at a 5 min walk distance, perfect to get picnic supplies. A lot of walks can be started from the hotel so the car doesn’t need to be used every single day. Lots of walks and other activities are also organized by the hotel but we did not participate in these as it was our first visit in this region. To conclude, one of the better hotels we have stayed in with great studios and excellent food. Highly recommended for a wonderful summer holiday.",family,POS
“BEYOND - BEYOND - BEYOND”,"While we are long-time guests of Berghotel, this Christmas was our very first winter stay. The perfection we always admired during the summer was no less in the winter. The refined Christmas decorations, the extra special dinner menus on Christmas Eve and Day, the warm, family feeling of these holidays were exceptional. The word which most comes to mind is """"BEYOND"""" - beyond ones expectations and hopes. The attention to detail, the variety of the buffets and served menus, the common room decorations, the perfect but unstuffy service, the efficiency of the Reception staff, the BEAUTY of the location, the outdoor hot tubs as well as the lovely spa are all well BEYOND what one can expect and hope for. Berghotel is a winner - it has never disappointed. To the contrary it seems to continually improve somehow on excellence - which is quite a feat! The magic of the many summers was equalled by the magic of the winter holiday/Christmas season. The Holzer family is truly dedicated to guests' well-being, enjoyment, pleasure. In every way they go ABOVE and BEYOND to offer an unforgettable stay, a memorable time in their corner of paradise. There is no better location in the area...and there is no finer hotel!",family,POS
“PROBABLY THE BEST HOTEL WE HAVE EVER VISITED”,"We stayed at the Berg Hotel for 3 nights in June, as our son and daughter-in-law had stayed there previously and recommended it to us so we all went together To say we were not disappointed would be the understatement of the year. It truly must be the best hotel we have ever encountered. Firstly the scenery - nothing I could say could do it justice. You really would have to see it to believe it. You feel you could reach out and touch the Dolomites, they are so close. The facilities are second to none, with a beautiful spa area, and outdoor and indoor swimming pools. This really amazed me, as you enter the indoor pool, which has panoramic windows to the Dolomites, and swim through a small opening to the outdoor pool, which is heated and is really more or less at the foot of the Dolomites. We stayed in the summer, however, my son and daughter-in-law have photos of their previous stay during the winter, where they are happily swimming in the outdoor pool, surrounded by snow, The staff all wear typical tyrolean dress, and are so helpful and courteous. The food is something truly special, with an abundance of local delicacies. There was a speciality 'sweet' evening during our visit, and there were three large tables all decorated with the most amazing sweets. The rooms are bright and spacious and the cupboard / wardrobe space is abundant. The smallest details are taken care of, like for example we even had a courtesy rucksack in our rooms. We are hoping to return to the Berg Hotel in the near future and would highly recommend it to anyone Room Tip: South facing rooms are said to have the better views See more room tips",couple,POS
"“Beautiful mountain views, but construction noise, bad parking, and bad cancellation policy”","We were disappointed by our stay at the Berghotel, even though the mountain view from our porch was very pretty. They're building a parking lot right across from the hotel, and you can hear the noise (not too loud in the room with the porch door closed) from 7 in the morning to 6 at night. You can't just sit out on your porch during the day and enjoy the view. We also were never told when we checked in that we could park in the lower level of the parking garage under construction; we just found out by accident on our third day there. So, we had to squeeze our compact car into an incredibly small upper parking lot with no room to turn the car around. We were glad that we had full insurance on our car. Due to the 30-day cancellation policy, we couldn't cancel our reservation. The lady at the front desk, who we told about the construction noise in our room, even told me that I was wrong when I said I could hear the construction noise inside my room. Luckily, another much friendlier and more professional desk clerk was on duty at the end of our stay. The food was plentiful and pretty good. There is one computer in the bar area you can use (again, we were not told this and had to discover it on our own; the brochure in our room only mentioned wifi access in the hotel). The man at the bar was very friendly and helped us to use the computer. You can walk about 150 meters down the one lane road to Schaffer's to buy picnic food and drinks every day but Sunday. This is a good base for some really good hiking (about 5 minutes drive to the Via Fiscalina lift, about 10 minutes drive to the Monte Elmo lift, and about an hour total drive to the amazing Tre Cime hiking area with its amazing views). There is a webcam in the hotel lobby that shows pictures of visibility at Tre Cime and Monte Elmo. Once the construction is done, this should be a much nicer place to stay. Right now, with the high price of the Berghotel and hundreds of places to stay in the Dolomites, I can't recommend this place.",couple,NEG
“Very rural smells... Reasonably comfortable”,As seems to have been a bit of a theme on our trip... This was a last minute stay as the planned host mixed up dates and could only accommodate one family of our part. They booked us on to here... And after enjoying a drink at the place our friends were staying we made our way to Hotel WInkler which was a bit of a disppointment. Our room overlooked the road and barn so smelt very rural... Windows open as it was hot so smelly inside. Third bed was a pull down in the kitchen... Which rendered the kitchen useless and e out don't open the door breeze. Think it is more of a winter ski spot and woud be great then Indoor pool was lovely. Room Tip: Ask for a room with views over the valley (beautiful) rather than the road.

“I have seen better places in that area for the rates they count”,"It's clean, good breakfast, excellent rooms, great pool and spa area, nothing to complain! Great location to explore that part of the Dolomites. Two things were a bit weird during our stay. The menu card in the hotel was only in German and Italian, while the rest of Italy English is getting pretty common. They charge 5 euro per hour for internet which is insane comparing to FREE internet in other 3, 4 and 5 star hotels we stayed during our Italy trip. It was the only place we had to pay for it. It's a nice hotel, but the price is to steep for the service they count for. Room Tip: If you use the internet a lot during your stay, then staying here is not a good choice. 5 euro per h...

“Hotel with self catering apartments and great pool/sauna area”,"We stayed here for 6 nights in a self-catering apartment located across from the hotel. We travelled by motorbike and used this as our base for day trips to Bolzano, Brunico and Chiusa/Klausen. The apartment consisted of one room with a double bed, pull-out sofa, corner dining table for 4 (Eckbank), a kitchenette with 2 hot plates and sink, and a bathroom with shower, toilet and bidet. There was a small TV and fridge. 2 balconies provided us with a nice view of Bressanone/Brixen. The rooms had apparently been newly renovated with wooden floors and everything was clean and modern. We had the use of the sauna and pool area in the hotel, which was lovely after a day out on the bike. You could swim out from the small indoor pool to the larger outdoor pool area. There were many deckchairs both inside and outside, and even magazines to read. There was also a fitness room with treadmill, exercise bike, etc. Unfortunately we never ate at the restaurant because we cooked every night (small shop in the village, big supermarket at the bottom of the hill before entering Brixen)! The Brixen Card we got from the hotel was GREAT: it let us into so many museums for free, e.g. all the Messner Mountain Museums and the Archaeology Museum in Bolzano. The hotel caters for motorbike groups, so it can get a bit loud in the mornings when they all drive off! and the garage was very full in the evenings! We really enjoyed our stay here, if not for the rain it would have been perfect!",couple,POS
“Lovely hotel”,"The hotel is immaculate. We had a junior suite and the room was very spacious. Situated in a small, quiet village with beautiful views. Staff very friendly and although they don't speak much english, we never had a problem making ourselves understood. Small fridge in the room which was great for keeping our wine/milk chilled. No kettle/cups in room so take a travel kettle, if like us, you like your early morning cuppa!. There is a small spar supermarket for supplies if needed. If you are looking for a location with lots of restaurants, nightlife etc, then this is not the place, however is you are looking for a relaxing few days then this is just the ticket. We would definitely go back to this hotel without any hesitation",couple,POS

"“What a wonderful, beautifully-situated hotel!”","Hotel Traubenheim (and Hotel Sonnbichl) For 5 days last week, my wife and I had a wonderful stay at Hotel Traubenheim in beautiful Dorf Tirol, located just above the attractive town of Merano. Hotel Traubenheim, and its adjacent sister hotel, Hotel Sonnbichl, have a fantastic location, with most rooms looking out to the mountains and down upon Merano. My review relates to both hotels as guests are encouraged to use the facilities at both. By way of credibility, I should mention that I have traveled extensively in over 65 countries and have visited most parts of Europe countless times. We had a wonderful experience at Hotel Traubenheim and I am confident in saying that both of these hotels are as nice as you’re going to find anywhere. The rooms are spacious and clean and the well-designed bathrooms are at least twice the size you’ll find at most other hotels. Parking is ample, with most of it located in a secure, underground garage. It is a very enjoyable walk from the hotel up to the center of Dorf Tirol From there, one can enjoy interesting, short strolls through the town or engage in hours-long hikes along well-marked trails to castles, through apple orchards and vineyards and, of course, into the incredible, surrounding mountains. There are even chairlifts available to enable you to start your hiking at higher elevations if you prefer. While we used our hotel as a base from which to explore the surrounding area and even a trip to the Dolomites, we had the impression that a number of visitors were content to stay put at the hotels themselves given their many health-oriented amenities. The hotels offer all kinds of resources to make one’s stay a real treat – ranging from various pools, hot tubs, spa and sauna facilities, a tennis court and ping pong table, etc. The hotel offers an extensive and delicious breakfast buffet. In the evening, you have the choice of having a simple dinner at Traubenheim’s restaurant or a 5-course feast at Hotel Sonnbichl. We sampled both and were extremely pleased. The 5-course meal was outstanding and the wine selection excellent. While all of the above are important attributes, what makes these hotels truly great is the welcoming attitude offered by the staff. As family-owned hotels, the owners take pride in making sure that guests are treated in a very caring fashion. One night, for instance, Gertraud, one of the owners, kindly had us driven to a restaurant because we were running a little late. Anita, Christine and Hannes also went out of their way to befriend us. In just a short time, one gets to know the family and staff so that one experiences a much more personal stay. I will offer just one criticism that I know these hotels are working on. While we could always access our emails and other internet-related sites, the hotel interfaces are not in keeping with their 5-star ratings in all other respects. The log-in process is a bit of a hassle (e.g., having to reenter log-in info every 45 minutes or so) and the connections are not always the best. Hopefully, management can make some significant headway in addressing these concerns by the 2014 season. In sum, I highly recommend that others experience these hotels firsthand. They are wonderfully situated and beautifully designed and, when combined with the many available pool/spa resources, delicious meals and very friendly staff and family, make guests feel that they have just experienced an ideal hotel stay – which indeed they have!

“An honest family run hotel”,The hotel is a typical Bavarian style hotel by a main road with a concrete banked river on the other side of the road. It is close to a main bus route. The hotel is clean and fine for a three star hotel. Rooms at the front are a little noisier than those at the back but rooms at the back have the benefit of a seven o'clock wake up from the local church clock.,friends,NEG
“Ad maiorem Dei gloriam”,"It's difficult to find right words to describe how excellent is this hotel and restaurant. We have been at Romantik Hotel Oberwirt many times and each experience has been memorable. Stunning location a few miles away from Meran. Over five centuries of uninterrupted tradition in hospitality Always with the charming Family Waldner, takes care of their discerning guests. Rooms are simply decorated in Dolomites style and everything is simply perfect: cleaning, bathrooms, amenities,etc. The restaurant is really top-notch and second to none in the region. Creativity and elegance expressed by Chef Werner (and his kitchen staff) made always all courses a memorable tasting experience: here it's possible to be so impressed every day by this very fine cuisine that we wanted not to leave and to remain for ever in this gourmet paradise. This time we have been so impressed also by the fabulous wines combined with our meals and we choiced all wines produced by Sepp Waldner vineyards : one of this wines has a really appropriate label """"Gloria Dei"""", a terrific white, possibly the best Sauvignon Blanc combined with Weißburgunder and Riesling in the world. Please Family Waldner keep your style and charm for ever. Highly recommended.",couple,POS
"“Stunning location, avoid rooms in the dependance.”","We stayed here for one night in the """"dependance"""" and were a bit wary as there are no photos of the rooms on the website. Positives: Superb views Good eateries in the village and perhaps half board might be nice Good breakfast Nice walks from the front door of the hotel Easy parking at the dependance. (Not so at the hotel during the day.) Relatively friendly service. Rooms have spacious balconies, but you only get the sun in the summer. Very clean albeit worn out. Negatives: We openly asked them how much the rooms varied from the Hotel rooms and they said not so much. On arrival I was tempted to leave but we had family with us and did not want the disruption. Service was friendly but the house has not been updated since it was built. Old fashioned and worn carpets, black, worn out shower base, green en suites....also, the hot water tended to run out. At €42pp I found it, quite frankly, daylight robbery. In my opinion this is closer to a cheap hostel than even a guesthouse. If the prices were less it would not be so bad, but at these prices you would expect some re-investment in the building. On an aisde, in autumn, there is hardly any sunlight on the whole hotel area from about 3pm onwards so I would recommend looking in Algund area or somewhere on the other side of the valley. In summer this might not be a problem here. To eat we went to the Oberwirt in the same village which was fantastic and next time I would consider spending a little extra and staying here. Unfortunately, we booked last minute and it was high season so our choices were limited. Potentially the actual Hotel itself might be much better, and the photos on the website definitely look ok.",family,NEG
“fantastic service”,"this is really a jewel. A beautiful, quiet location with a beautiful view of the Merano valley. Lots of things to do in the neighborhood, and great weather (300 days with sun per year). But the best of this hotel is the owner and all her staff; you will not get friendlier and more helpful people anywhere. The service all around was excellent, the food superb. Personal wishes were attended in the best possible way. It will not be easy to forget this place and its people. Room Tip: ask for a room overlooking the valley. See more room tips",friends,POS
“A Mixed Bag”,"It's difficult to write a review for this hotel so I'll start with the best part which is the food which is of high quality with a choice of main course. It's is quite rich but you can balance this out by visiting the salad buffet. Staff friendly and helpful although a little slow at times. The standard room was adequate however it was stuck in a 1970s timewarp with brown in evidence everywhere and an old and non-functioning radio. Generally clean and well looked after. We were one of the only youngish couples there as the other guests were older couples or families with young children so bear this in mind if it bothers you. What annoyed me about this hotel and the reason I wouldn't recommended it is all the sneaky charges. You want a bathrobe in a supposed wellness hotel that will be 10 Euro each sir. You want to partake in the wine tasting, sure, we will charge you the full restaurant price of each bottle opened instead of the retail price which we will helpfully tell you the next day in case you want to buy more. Which of course we didn't after receiving the hefty bill for the wine tasting. Cake buffet in the afternoon a standard touch in Tirol, North and South. You want to have some tea or coffee to go with your cake we will charge you for that too. Guess you're starting to get the idea. Any wellness treatments you have will appear as diverse on the final bill so good luck working out what they are. While I'm talking about the massages it was the strangest one I've ever had and involved more shaking and joint rotation than pressure. Don't believe it was what any physiotherapist or any well trained masseur would recommend. Pools shabby with a random collection of loungers which look like they have been bought from the local Aldi so despite the high temperatures I didn't take a dip. In conclusion if you don't mind driving every day as the public transport is minimal and want a cheap hotel with good food and a good location then this does the job otherwise there are better choices in the area. Room Tip: Pay extra for the upgraded rooms instead of the standard rooms. See more room tips",couple,NEG
“Looking forward to staying again”,"On arrival at Pacher I had very mixed feelings, having made a last minute reservation via a much publicized engine that I had never used before. TA reviews in Italian were fairly mixed ranging from very good to the disastrous of the most recent one. What my daughter and I got was a very large room with balcony, all possible accoutrements for the wellness area (not only the mandatory towel-robe bat also beach towels -changed every day-, plastic flip-flops and even a tote bag with our room number), limited but top-of-the-range organic toiletries. Breakfast was extremely rich and we decided to give the restaurant a go, switching to half-board. All our dinners were 5-course gourmet experiences, served in style by very professional staff. The feeling was every inch that of a top restaurant rather than the hotel-cum-restaurant that you easily get when you stay half or full board. The wine list was extensive but rather pricey. A garden is available for al-fresco dining and drinks. The wellness area is not very large, but spotlessly clean, with splash pool, Jacuzzi, sauna, steam bath, power showers, cold tub, relaxation bed. It opens onto two separate decks for sunbathing. Free herbal teas; massage and other treatments payable on demand. The only drawback is the closeness to the road, definitely noisy by day but blissfully quiet at night. Highly recommended for a relaxing weekend or short holiday. Or simply for dining if you happen to pass by.",family,POS
“Wonderfull!”,"We are Europeans but living in Canada. My husband and I enjoyed 1 week last September in this hotel and can't wait to go back.

The food was excellent and more than plenty,we had breakfast and dinner included(Halbpension) The indoor pool with outside pool open in the afternoon was great. The only drawback was the 1 computer for guests in the lobby, but probably the other 4-5 star hotels which are located a bit ouside of St. Ulrich in higher altitude might have same server/reception problem. There is even a small playground and a hottub overlooking the Grödner valley. Room Tip: If you need a lot of space ,ask for a corner superior room with 2 balconies. See more room tips",couple,POS

“Stunning ski holiday”,"I spent a ski-holiday week with friends at Hotel Scherlin in Ortisei. It's located upon a hill in about 10 mins drive from the town. A cozy family owned hotel with very nice wellness facilities like indoor & outdoor swimming pool, whirpool, steam room, aromatic, Finnish and alpen saunas. Staff is wery kind and speak fluent English, which I found rare in Italy. Our room was spotlessly clean, spacious and though I did not asked nor payed for it had a beautiful view over Ortisei. Halfboard includes good buffet breakfast, which was enough till the evening when the usual four course dinner was served. There was only two minor thing found a bit unpleasant. First: the menu was only in Italian and German, though staff was always willing to help with the translation. Second: internet access was a bit problematic, since there was no wi-fi network around at all and the only internet access was a single public pc in the lobby with a quite slow connection. In general we spent a fantastic week in this hotel. A few more remarks on public transportation and signage in Val Gardena. You can get a weekly bus pass for 7 EUR and there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel where ski buses should stop according to a schedule. This all sounded ideal, so that you can leave the car in the garage for a week and no need to bother with parking around the ski lifts. In reality bus schedule is just an estimation, and it happened once that we were waiting for 45 mins for a bus to appear. Signage on the slopes is quite confusing because on the map they only indicate the ski lift number but not the actual slope number. We got lost a few times and also many times saw fellow skiers desperately studiing skimaps. Beside of these the place is the best I’ve ever been with its long, wide, well maintained slopes and without qeueing at the lifts.",friends,POS
“Stunning Scherlin”,"We stayed at the Hotel Scherlin in May and we found it to be one of the most fabulous hotels we have ever stayed in. Please take the time to look at the website [--] as this will give you a good idea of the quality of the hotel. The setting is at the end of the val gardena valley and the views are simply outstanding in every direction. We were given a beautiful suite decorated in rich reds and golds all recently renovated and with large balconies allowing us to make the most of the stunning views. The hotel has a wonderful heated indoor swimming pool with a wave machine which was great fun. There is also a gym, sauna, steam room, solarium and power shower. The restaurant is quite beautifully decorated with spectacular woodworking, as is the bar and lounge. The owner Tiziana is a lovely lady who speaks perfect English and cannot do enough to make your stay a pleasant one. The only problem we found with the hotel was leaving it!!

“Just when you think it can't get any better”,"We came around the corner into Santa Maddalena and knew we had picked THE most perfect vacation spot ever, just by seeing the magnificent Odle Mountain range looming to one side. Then we walk into the hotel and realized very quickly that we are staying in an art museum - beautiful wood sculptures everywhere, which I'm told were created by the owner's father. The pictures adorning the walls were beautiful as well. Just when we thought it couldn't possibly get any better, we go down for dinner and are treated to a very lovely (and unique) dining experience which was part of our half-board package followed by star-gazing on the outdoor furniture. Wow. I cannot say enough good things about this property - it was a perfect base for exploring the nearby mountain ranges. Birgit and her husband were extremely helpful in guiding us to gondolas and cable cars in the Val Gardena/Ortisei area which provided the most spectacular views I've ever seen.

“Warm welcome”,"We traveled by the 1:00 train from Munich to Brixen, Italy and from there took the 45 minute bus ride to Santa Maddelena. We caught the bus at the train station, on the same side of the street about 5:15, so simple. Michael, the hotel owner was able to give us a ride to the hotel, after we called. This is a charming family owned hotel in a beautiful setting. German and Italian are the 2 first languages with English perhaps third. That being said, if you are English only speaking, it is not hard to converse. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The bed, what we have come to expect in a typical European setting, which is low to the ground and on the firm side, with a duvet for each person. We chose to have half board, which includes breakfast and dinner. Breakfast included the wonderful German breads and rolls, ham, cheese, yogurt, dry cereal, wet cereal, fresh fruit as well as coffee, juice and water. At breakfast we were presented with the detailed options of the dinner menu. There were always 2 appetizers and 2 entrees, one of which was vegetarian. Dinner also included an extensive salad bar with at least 15 or more salads. Each dinner was delicious without exception. If you want water at dinner, it is always bottled and is a small extra charge. Beer, wine and cocktails are also available. The menus were in both German and Italian. If you have trouble figuring it out, the servers are happy to practice their English. One thing I wish we had done, was to ask for a tour of the hotel. There are many spa services we were not aware of. One of the themes of this hotel is art. The retired owner is an artist of exceptional talent. Even though it was cool and rainy for much of the week we stayed at the Hotel-Tyrol, we hiked in the valley daily. Everything is either uphill or down, there is virtually no flat ground.

“Excellent Value (On Non-Disco Nights)”,"Stayed three times in June, using the hotel as a base for stays in the Dolomites (they allowed us to use left luggage without any charge). Best value for SPG points that we've seen in Europe. Courtyard facing room was fantastic - big bed with quality linens, couch, chair, table - lots of deep reds, greys, and browns. Complimentary in-room safe, coffee, robe and slippers. Free use of the pool and gym. Internet is very reasonable - 7.70 euro for 24 hours and the connection is strong and fast. Air conditioning is excellent - something that is priceless in Bolzano in the summer. Rooms were extremely quiet except for our Saturday night stay. Maybe this was the disco other reviewers have complained of. We were too tired from hiking to deal with it, though. We did not enjoy the breakfast at all - terrible selection and quality. I would try to get a rate without it for our next trip. Getting to the hotel was very easy - take the No. 10B bus from the train station or the main town square (Sorry I can't remember the name!) to the Feira stop. To get back to hotel, take the No. 10A bus - it is across the street from where the 10B let's you off. Once we figured this out, it took 15 minutes each way. The tickets are 1 euro each or you can buy a 5 euro card at the tourist information office (also on that main square). Using the 5 euro card, you'll pay 65% for the city bus and various other local and regional transportation options. If you can plan ahead a little, the tourist office sells some other options such as 7 day options or 3 in 7 day options. We didn't use it, but I think parking was 20 euro per day (check with the hotel) Huge Spar grocery store is a five minute walk from the hotel - including a McDonald's if you need some cheap calories. Honestly, I recommend going to the tourist office with any question you can think of - they were extremely nice, helpful, and fluent in English.

"“Great pool, no sleep”","We stayed at this hotel for only one night. Had read the reviews about disco noise and specifically requested a quiet room on a higher floor. The room itself was brilliant-- great shower, comfy bed, plenty of room. The location, as noted by others, is not ideal but neither was it a big deal-- a short bus ride away, or in summer, you can take advantage of free bikes available near the train station and have a pleasant cycle to and fro on designated bike paths. Service on arrival was stiff but otherwise OK. The real problem was being kept awake until 4am by a pounding disco beat. So much for the quiet room request. In the morning, I asked what was up with the disco, and they claimed it was off site and out of their control. They said it normally happens on a Saturday night and they were surprised that it was also loud on a Friday. After a pleasant but firm exchange where I reminded them that I requested a quiet room, they just shrugged. Perhaps there isn't a quiet room in the house on disco nights. Given our lack of sleep, we asked for a delayed checkout until 1pm. They said normal check out time was 10am, and treated this request as a big deal. They did ultimately grant it but the customer service damage was done. On balance, I would stay here again only if it was a free room with SPG points AND if it wasn't a weekend.",couple,NEG

We spent every afternoon there just lounging around the pool - very relaxing! There are unfortunately 2 negatives points, one of course is the location. It's miles out of the centre of Bolzano, in an industrial area near the airport (although you can't here any noise). Ways of getting into town are by bus - cheap, takes about 15 minutes, get to see a bit of Bolzano, not too bad - or by taxi - which we did back again in the evening - costs about 15 euros, I think. Second point is the dining choice - of course being an upmarket 4-star hotel the restaurants have to be stylish and expensive - but being with my teenage daughter we wanted to go somewhere lively and not too expensive and so unfortunately we ended up not eating in the hotel - would have been nice if they had had a smart bistro with cheaper dishes available. But all in all, a really lovely hotel - beautiful modern rooms, lovely swimming pool and great bar!",None,NEG
“Excellent hotel outside of main tourist area”,"We stayed 2 nights, using Starwood Points, at this lovely hotel. Relative to other highly rated Bolzano hotels, the location of the Four Points isn't the best--it's in an industrial area (warehouses, a convention center, furniture showrooms) on the city outskirts, with no real attractions to speak of beyond a gigantic Interspar supermarket and possibly the nicest McDonalds I've ever seen (Cathedral ceilings, leather seating, chandeliers, marble slab tables, a fireplace). Anyway...on to the hotel: rather dark and Euro-mod-ish lobby, friendly and attentive check-in process (thank you for being multi-lingual, I was quite rusty on my German and Italian after a long trip in from the States...thanks for obligingly speaking English!) room: large (by European standards) with a spacious modern bath, a/c. everything was modern and very clean. ample closet space, as well as a desk area to spread out your stuff. Our particular room also had a sofa and space for an extra bed. Pool and spa area is as nice as the promotional photos depict. The hotel website (last time I checked) does not even depict the outdoor deck area immediately adjoining the pool and also overlooking the mountains. One could spend a very pleasant few hours relaxing in this environment. We saw many couples on apparently romantic getaways--our trip (with 2 kids in tow, sharing our room) was not romantic but still quite fun for the family, with great accommodations. We explored Castelrotto and Bolzano easily and pleasantly from this hotel, and it was really nice to return to the plush modernity of the facilities/ Really, the only downside is the distance from the city. That said, the 20 min bus ride is fairly easy (trickier on the way back as the bus runs approx every 30-45 minutes, so plan wisely!), or a 20 min drive plus car park fees.",family,POS
“Meets Expectations”,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and it was exactly (if not better) than we had expected. The hotel is very chic but laid back and informal at the same time. The centre of Bolzano is easily reached by car or by bus (there is a bus stop just up the road). Our room was comfortable, spacious and immaculate. The pool area/sauna is great. Was a bit surprised that the main bar was a smoking area and would not recommend the restaurant (overrated).",couple,POS
"“SLOW Internet, expencive restaurant, unfriendly staff”","I was in busyness trip 5 days in this hotel. For internet connection in your room you pay 7,70 for 24 hours, but it is very, very, slow - you need a minute or too to change for one page to another. The same for 2 PC near receprion. 30 min -5 Euro, you hardly have time to log in in your e-mail. Restaurat offers very poor choice of meals and it is VERY OVERPRICED. Portions are small, they even use frosen potato gnocci..... Not all of them, but receptionist female mit dark curly hair was unfreunly. She should leart the word THANK YOU. Some of furniture pieces near reception (yellow sofas) are dirty and with holes. The breakfast should be richer too. Coffe pots are cold. bread rolls too hard. Parking for HOTEL GUESTS cost 20 Euro for one day. I wouldn´t give more then 3 stars to this hotel.",None,NEG
“The Palce to Stay in Bolzano”,"This review is long overdue. We stayed at the Four Points in Bolzano in June 2009. It is an excellent hotel with large, quiet, modern, and well-furnished rooms and a large bathroom. Both the room and the bath were well-maintained and very clean. The room offers TV news programs in English and a mini-bar where you can store your snacks. The front-desk staff is excellent--extremely courteous and helpful and they go out of their way to help as they did for us giving us much personal attention. The hotel is not in the center of town and to get to the town center--which is not all that much to write home about-- you should take a short bus ride unless you like long walks. The bus-stops are close to the hotel. Do not bother with a taxi since the buses run frequently. If you have a car, you can park it free of charge on the street perpendicular to the front of the hotel. If you are driving, the hotel can be hard to find, but you should be all right if you pay close attention and find the crucial right hand turn onto a side street soon after you leave the highway and cross the river into town. The food at the hotel is expensive, and we did not east there. The charge for the buffet breakfast was unreasonably high so we used the large supermarket a short walk to the left as you leave the hotel to pick up breakfast supplies. There is also a large MacDonald’s next door if that is your thing. But we went into town for dinners. We highly recommend the Batzenhausl which was suggested to us by the front-desk staff. The food was excellent. But be cautious in ordering. The servings are very large and more than one person can eat. We had the most fantastic pork shoulder we have ever eaten. The Four Points would be our place to stay if we were to stop in Bolzano again. If you have Sheraton points, the hotel is an excellent value if you are there when they are accepting “cash and points” reservations.",couple,POS
“Amazing all-around experience”,"We stayed for a week with a group of friends and the one thing I can say is that they know how to make their guest feel extremely welcomed. When booking a hotel with diner included, my first guest is that the food is expected to be average. I was wrong, I was blown away by the quality of the ingredients and the attention to detail when preparing the meals. If your group decide to choose the option of having diner in the special dining room for a small extra, you must try the pumpkin raviolis!! The owner Mikael (not sure if the spelling is right) is an amazing somelier and will always suggest the perfect wine to join any meal at any budget. They have wines that you will never find anywhere else (I even proposed to buy some to bring back home and refused to make sure his guests can enjoy it at his hotel) They also provide an all-day shuttle in the village whenever you need to go (before 7pm) The owner can also organise ski tours for guests where he will bring you to the best spots to ski and the best huts to eat during the day. The rooms are also very clean and well maintained. Very friendly staff. All around, a very memorable stay and will come back next year!

“Great Pool and views”,"Nice dramatically modern hotel. Views from rooftop pool were amazing. Nice showers by pool and hot tub. Stayed on points. upgraded to a suite so our 9 year old had her own little piece of the room. Nice decor and large bathrooms. Went into town via car. I actually like Bolzano's main square. Nice church right off the main square with all sorts of restaurants. Walked over bridge across water. Found a great little place that served kebabs and such. We were here only overnight on our way to Verona and then Milan. Would definitely stay again for the pool if I wanted to visit the Dolomites. Ate dinner at hotel restaurant. It was good and atmosphere/decor fairly upscale. I had never stayed at a Four Points before, so I was expecting something different. Hotel is not central though. Located in an industrial park right off highway but you don't get any noise. Parked for free (it was Sunday) overnight and in town for free. But the front desk offers map and directions for a bus. But it seems there is free parking in abundance on side streets. Great service and quite accomodating.",family,POS
“Good choice”,Modern hotel located outside the city center by Fiera Bolzano/Messe Bozen/The Bolzano Fair. Only stayed overnight so no experience from wellness facilities. + Good breakfast buffet + Modern and clean + Comfortable beds + Easy access from Autostrada + Street parking - Loud air conditioning - Free wi-fi only in reception area,family,POS
"“Hotel overbooks, moves my confirmed reservation”","I booked a deluxe room at the Four Points Bolzano in early August for a late September 2 night stay, and received a confirmation. A week before I was due to leave for Italy, I received an email from the hotel stating that they had overbooked the nights in question and were not going to honor my reservation, and that they and that they had booked me a room at another, older hotel in Bolzano instead. Needless to say this was very disconcerting as the Four Points is one of the few modern, chain based hotels in this area. I escalated this issue to Sheraton and after a week of back and forth the hotel finally agreed to honor the reservation. So...be aware your confirmed and guaranteed reservation means nothing to these folks if they see an opportunity to make a fast buck from someone willing to pay more for a room. On to the review: this property is a contemporary style hotel with good sized rooms and modern furnishings. It's location is not ideal in an industrial zone - my windows were either frosted or covered with dirt so that you did not have to look at the stark concrete next door. I found the hotel to be poor value - 180E for 2 people plus 20E for parking, and the restaurant meals were pricy. Still, your choice in this area appears to be family owned chalet style lodge hotels in the Dolomites, older style classic hotels, or this property.",couple,NEG
“Unbelievable”,"This was a pretty nice hotel however I couldn't believe how terrible the service was from the hotel staff. At one point there was a fire and we had several fire engines and an ambulance turn up, however, the hotel staff refused to evacuate the hotel even though there was a strong smell of smoke. I approached the hotel reception who wouldn't even acknowledge that there was a fire or a safety issue. There were also some problems with parking - reception referred us to another car park further up the street which turned out to be closed. The hotel itself was fairly nice but that was certainly let down by the attitude of the staff.",friends,NEG
“Just ok”,This four points is located next to the convention center away from downtown. When we stayed there was a loud party going on - we were on the 7th floor and could hear a bid to well. Staff is nice though. Lobby smells like smoke and the elevators are too few and too slow! Wait is going on forever. Skipped the overpriced buffet for coffee and croissant in the hotel bar. Much better value!,couple,NEG
“Great Use of SPG Points”,"Stayed here for one night in late August 2011. A friend booked my stay using 4,000 SPG points. Since she is SPG Platinum, we were upgraded to an executive room with a nice bottle of flat water and some chocolates as a welcome gift. Front desk spoke English well and other than the lack of a real drive up lobby (there's 3 parkings spaces right in front), the hotel was great. The executive room was a nice suite with modern furniture and decor, and a huge tub bathroom. To avoid paying the exorbitant parking rates, we parked along the street. During the day, it's metered parking but in the evening, it is free with plenty of open spots. Even though the hotel is in an industrial area, I felt perfectly safe parking my new BMW outside (picked up in Munich via European Delivery). Internet was available in room and of decent speed. Hotel pool was also fabulous with an outdoor deck.",couple,POS
“Everything you could wish for on a skiing holiday”,"In 26 years of skiing in Europe, Canada & the US Sporthotel Panorma has to be the best hotel we have ever had the pleasure of discovering. From the day of our arrival until departure we could not ask for a better quality of service, professionalism, friendliness and helpfulness to make our stay such a memorable one. This is a family run hotel which is clearly shown in the care taken to ensure the needs of all guests are met. We would highly recommend this superb establishment to lovers of good food, comfort and the excellent spa facilities after a hard days skiing. Room Tip: Beautiful views from Panorama Rooms See more room tips",friends,POS
“is it a real starwood hotle?”,"The room rate was € 170 B&B for a basic (classic) room (523). The first direct approach was a disaster as I called them to inform about my late arrival and to confirm their email offer for an upgrade to a jr suite for + € 19 per day. The person on the phone (reception) was way too much cold and strict explaining that the offer was meant for families with children … not for couples. There was no way to discuss the matter without unpleasant fight as this condition was not mentioned in the email. I gave up as I did not want to spoil my short end of the year holiday. The location of the hotel is in an industrial area of BZ but I do not complain about this: I knew from the web their location and I didn’t mind. I rather complain for the extra cost I was charged and for the poor service received!!! € 7,70 per day for the internet connection!!!! € 15,00 for serving 1 breakfast in the room seen that one of us had to stay with our dog who cannot access the restaurant, € 15,00 per day for our dog, € 20,00 per day for the parking. Then to access the parking you have to ring a bell that is located in a most uncomfortable position unreachable from the car window being much too low on the wall. This applies at the entrance and at the exit… Twice happened that both electr room keys could not operate the lift nor open the door of our room, the reception could not manage to fix them so they had to come, operate the lift and open the door…for us. they did not charge for this though.... It also happened that we found in the room dirty clothes that had been used by the house keeping to clean... Finally the last day I ordered breakfast at 09.00 am and I was informed that the eggs were finished… already! There is a grocery shop just in front of the hotel so I suggested they could go and buy them I really had to insist to have them. They finally arrived after 1 hour… At checkout I saw that the invoice was in the name of my partner…they explained that they could not see my address from my Greek ID … even though the reservation was made through their site with my SPG (loyalty card) number that carries all my details… Last but not least my SPG status was totally ignored!!! Shall I return? I am not sure. I hope they fix their problems and of course their cost…",couple,NEG
“Excellent hotel”,"Just returned from a skiing trip . The hotel was in an excellent position 50 metres from chair lift or 100 metres from the nearest piste. Staff were excellent and very efficient and very friendly. Always willing to change course at dinner if something not to your liking. Owners were very charming and very visible around the hotel. Food was excellent. The breakfasts were outstanding and the dinners also. Several nights splendid pre-dinner buffets - tyrolean, fish etc. Wonderful dessert buffets. Look forward to returning",couple,POS
“Four Points is on point for business travelers”,"This is unabashedly a business-minded hotel, perfect for those with interests at Bolzano's fair grounds (next door), industrial park (idem), or the regional hospital (a short trip by freeway). For those who want to visit city center, a local bus passes the hotel every 18 minutes or so and costs € 1.50, as opposed to € 12 for a taxi: travel time not much different between the two modes of transport. Desk service is German efficiency and Italian charm. They are fast to respond to specific requests. Rooms have super-comfortable beds (pillows are of the soft, downy style, though, not my taste), good lighting, large wall-hung flat-screen TVs, bathtubs with both overhead rain shower and hand-held shower heads, plenty of fluffy towels, bathrobe and slippers, and in-room coffee/tea service. Lots of electric plugs for various devices. Fast Internet everywhere. Surprising lack of bathroom """"accessories"""". Breakfast is plentiful if not particularly interesting.

“Lovely hotel.Pity about the location”,"I endorse recent reviews . We stayed for a week . Inside the hotel is standard Sheraton - excellent staff,spotlessly clean,good food and fine spa area . Apart from being too far from the centre of town,there are no restaurants or bars anywhere near and no green areas to provide some atmosphere , No matter how good the glazing is,it is simply not possible to shut out the noise from the adjoining warehouses .We had the dubious benefit of a convention of bikers,all of whom had to test their engines before leaving . The oddest feature of the hotel is the use of frosted glass on the bedroom windows and dining area obviously to stop the neighbours looking in but creating a claustrophobic effect . The hotel is used extensively for overnight conference stays and coach tour stops . I am a Sheraton fan but this hotel is unattractive as holiday accomodation. Room Tip: Because of the frosted glass it is difficult to say . We could not get wifi to work in our room. See more room tips",couple,POS
“Excellent in every way”,"A sixth visit to Bulla in seven years and everything was as good as it always is. Great friendly service from Leopold and his team, good food (the prosciutto in crosto on Thursday was a highlight) and as a bonus some of the best snow conditions any of us could recollect.

“Great family hotel in beautiful country setting”,"We spent a week in Val Gardena hiking and decided on the Sporthotel Platz as our base. The hotel is in the small village of Bulla/Pufels, high on the hill above Ortisei. It was a great choice, as the main villages on the valley floor were extremely crowded with vacationers, since it was the week of Ferragosto. The hotel is run by two brothers (Andreas and Leo) who have taken the family farm and transformed it into a well run hotel. They are extremely gracious hosts, even putting on a great ferragosto party, with a table full of tapas and a wine punch. The staff was very friendly. The hotel itself is modest, our room was small and the food was average (except the Friday fish evening, where the chef produced a wonderful menu with fish stew, clam linguini and grilled salmon). It was great value for money. By the way, the hiking in Val Gardena is spectacular.",friends,POS
“Brilliant hotel”,This is a superb hotel in a lovely out of the way location - but only a short bus ride from the main town. Fantastic views and brilliant food. The five course dinner every night was really top quality and loved by all my family. All the staff are lovely and are always trying to make your stay a special one. On one evening guests and staff had a musical night that was really good - with a fire specially made for us on the veranda with views over the mountains. The walk up to the Seiser Alm is unforgettable. Room Tip: Just ask the staff See more room tips,family,POS
“Top class care for far less euros!!!”,"Fabulous, traditional hotel in Heidi type setting. Leopold and all his staff work effortlessly to ensure a tremendous time had by all. Food is amazing with wonderful 5 course dinner. Breakfast like a king with so many choices. All this plus the sauna and pool (big enough to swim in). Easy access to slopes by car or ski bus in winter. BeautIful surroundings in summer with outdoor pool and terrace to relax on. Impromptu sing songs with Leopold on accordion sometimes accompanied by ski instructor brother Andreas! Tobogganing trips and numerous other ideas to make this an unforgettable trip regardless of age.Rooms are traditional and some may say in need of a touch up. However I found my room/bed very cosy with a wonderful balcony view. Hot water in the shower and everything I needed. You would pay a lot more for this just 5 minutes down the mountain! Very easy access from Innsbruck (1hour 20 minutes) or Verona/Trevisso/Bergamo (take in Lake Garda, Bolzano and the wine trail of Kaltern). You won't be disappointed!

“Great value and kind staff”,"Stayed as part of a group DIY ski trip (flew to Munich and drove down). Small family-run hotel that has a personal feel. Friendly staff and great value. Rooms are simple and clean which is all we needed as we were rarely in them. Food and bar are very good. The sauna and small pool are welcome after a day's ski-ing. Fantastic view up the valley from our balcony. Bulla itself is only 10 mins drive from Ortisei and a bit quiet in the evening - the hotel bar is very convivial though. First time I have had to drive to the slopes each day and far less hassle than I thought. Think of it as a personal ski-bus - you just need to nominate a driver!.

Our apartment was new, clean, and every detail was thoroughly thought of.

"“Disappointed in room, more disappointed with owner's attitude!”","My husband and I were very excited about our stay in Ortisei-St.Ulrich in August 2005. It was to be the final leg of a two-week trip in the beautiful Trentino-Alto Adige region, celebrating our first wedding anniversary. Ortisei itself is a cute enough little town with plenty of fresh air, walking trails, surrounded by lush green fields (some of which become ski runs in winter), peek-a-boo views of the Dolomite mountains and pretty flower boxes. There is a little town center with a church, souvenir shops, boutiques and restaurants, bakeries, pizzerias. It is typical of the area - predominantly a skier's haven - but because region enjoys two high -seasons, it is also a beacon for hikers and climbers. Dozens of hotels, pensions, garni and quaint B&B's line the streets and dot the hillsides everywhere. German is the primary language, Italian secondary, and many people speak a little English. My husband and I speak both Italian and English, so we did not have any language difficulty. Ortisei-St. Ulrich It is situated in Val Gardena, which includes other ski resort/spa- type towns such as S. Cristina and Selva Gardena. Val Gardena seems a little more low-key and less pretentious than other more well-known ski resort areas in the Dolomites. but also has less dramatic mountain vistas. From Val Gardena, you can drive to Passo Sella (awesome) or across Passo (mountain pass) Gardena .....to ski/spa towns in Alta Badia (look up Corvara in Badia...lovely) these are windy mountain roads... but well worth the white knuckles for 360-degree views of the Dolomites and excellent walking trails -- just magnificent. Glaciers, grazing mountain cows, green meadows with wildflowers, jagged peaks, FRESH AIR...and almost all the passes have a restaurant or two with decent food and hot chocolate, cappuccino and don't miss the apple struedel! Now about the hotel…..We booked Hotel Alpenheim through a popular website featured on trip advisor (which we have used many times and have always been very satisfied). The hotel is very pretty and is situated on a narrow street outside of town (where there are many other hotels, B&B's, etc.) upon a hill overlooking the valley. There is a wide passaggiata (walking trail) that takes you from the hotel into town, about a 20-30 minute stroll. Along the way there are a couple of little playgrounds for children. The Alpenheim has a four-star rating. It is very clean with well-manicured grounds, and (we believe) has some nice amenities like a Turkish bath, saunas, indoor pool, massages, pedicures, etc...... Our reservation was for 4 nights in a 'comfort' double room, which is their lower- priced room. We paid $166 Euro per night which included buffet breakfast. (Half board which includes dinner and breakfast was available, but we wanted B&B only) We required a hotel that allowed pets (we have two small dogs), so we accepted the fact that they may not want pets in their superior rooms. We usually spend most of our time away from our hotel, but are the type of travelers who enjoy coming back from sightseeing to relax and hangout in comfort. When we arrived to the hotel we were checked in efficiently enough by the owner but without any warmth or friendliness one would expect from the proprietor of a small family-run hotel. We were not given any information about breakfast times, amenities, services, the town, extras.....but we were offered a porter to help with the bags. When we got to our room (number 111) we were so shocked at the size. It was the smallest hotel bedroom I have ever seen, and I've stayed in many many hotels, particularly in Italy and other parts of Europe. Our reservation confirmation stated we would be changing rooms the next night, so we decided to be patient and stay the one night in the microscopic room. We tried to inquire later that afternoon, but the man (the father or father-in-law we believe) at the front desk was unable to help us directly (we’d have to wait for the secretary) Back to the room…..The bedroom part had been updated in the last couple of years, with wood moldings and accents... There were two down-style comforters too big for the bed so they overlapped each other and only two pillows. The bed was positioned diagonally in the room in order to be able to fit it in. I literally had to walk side-ways around it (the bed) to get to the bathroom. My husband could not lie down with his hands behind his head as the wall impeded his elbow from extending!! There was NO WHERE to put anything away, down, no place to get dressed, change, or put on make-up. The room measured maybe 3 X 3 meters or about 9 x 9 feet. (I might be being too generous) There was only one bed lamp on the small built-in wedge which served also as a 'headboard' and a small triangle piece of wood that served as a 'desk' in the opposite corner, and another small wood wedge above that with a 13” TV. We agreed that this must have been a single room before that they ‘upgraded’ to a double. There was a little square window and the curtain was torn, which in itself was rather depressing. There was a closet in the entryway for hanging clothes, some small shelves and a safe. No extra bed pillows! There were three hooks in the hall for hanging clothes/jackets, but one was broken. One day we came back and the broken hook was gone but was never replaced. The older gentleman we’d spoken to the first day walked into the room one morning without knocking…at least I was dressed! Never found out why he'd come in the room though. The bathroom had not been updated. Stale 1980’s brown floor tile (chipped and worn in places) and peach floral wall tile. It was clean enough and decent in size in comparison with the bedroom. There was a bathtub with a hand-held shower fixture, but was the old European type with no shower curtain and a slippery bathtub and a drain in the floor….water goes everywhere….brrrrrr! There was a small pedestal sink with a small narrow shelf, a toilet and a bidet. Towels were decent size. Over the sink was a small old mirror with the silver backing peeling off in places and a bare VERY DIM fluorescent tube light bulb over the mirror. Useless for shaving or putting on makeup. There was a small window with texturing for ‘privacy’ and a sad 1970’s-looking lime green swirl pattern curtain. The location of the room made the claustrophobia factor multiply by 10. While the hotel is nicely situated high on a hill overlooking Ortisei-St. Ulrich , with mountain and green pasture views, room 111 is on the back of the hotel, literally ON the street, DIRECTLY over the kitchen delivery entrance (and the trucks make early morning deliveries every day, leaving the diesel engines idling 3 feet from the window) …… The room faces the bottom of a sloped property, at a distance equal to the width of the small lane, giving it an even more closed-in feeling. People walking by can look directly into the room…rather a ‘fishbowl’ effect …forget about opening the bathroom window for much-needed light!! …..…. The kitchen staff and serving staff were very efficient and friendly but were also busily clanking pots and pans and plates and cutlery at early hours preparing for the 7:30 am breakfast, and it went on again in the afternoon preparing for the dinner and then the evening cleanup and preparations for the next day. The chef stood outside our window talking loudly on a cell phone for 20 minutes early one morning. The first night we went out for a walk for 30 minutes and came back and the room was infested with flying ants. The Alpenheim's website clearly shows the floor plan of one version of a ‘comfort’ room and a picture of another version. …both with desk, dresser, chairs, lamps, entrance closet, furnished balcony and even a VIEW. Our reservation was, we thought, as stated, a ‘comfort room’…..which would have been fine for us if it had been as advertised. . Some Comfort! (The breakfast was a good continental type…however, they have assigned seating and room number 111 must be the absolute DREGS reservation because instead of a nice sunny table with a window and view, we were sat in a corner, the only one with no possibility to see outside... Had we never left the hotel, we would have never known we were in the Dolomites!!!!) ) The second day after breakfast we asked about changing rooms (as it stated in the confirmation); we were told (by the owner himself) there were no other rooms available. We told him how unhappy we were and that we were very disappointed and that our room was not what we expected from a 4-star hotel. He told us he has no control over the reservations, that it’s not his fault and that it was (the reservation website’s) problem. (Although we received the email confirmation directly from the hotel? hmmm) In addition, he said that the flying ants were not their problem. This was the worst customer service I have ever encountered. He could have offered a discount, he could have offered a dinner, called another hotel in the area- anything. He SHOULD have apologized. Instead, for the rest of our stay, he avoided us, never made eye contact, never said a word to us. We were rarely at the hotel, dreaded going back there, felt like 2nd-class citizens, and it really put a big cloud over the last days of our holiday. Needless to say, we never felt welcome enough to use any of the amenities, whether they were the 'included' ones or the 'extras'. It was a VERY uncomfortable situation. (btw, we didn’t leave because we didn’t want to have to spend time during our last few days in high August tourist season in search of a new hotel, and the contract stated we would be charged in full for the room for an early departure.) Our advice is to look at the room before checking in. We decided it’s better to have the BEST room at a 2 or 3 star hotel than the lowest- priced room at a 4 or 5 star hotel.

"“Friendly, service-minded, picturesque hotel just outside ortisei”","We stayed at hotel Rodes for 1 week in July. We chose the hotel based on their familly orientation, half-board availability, and family-run establishment. We appreciated their generous breakfasts and dinners, where there were many options each day to choose from. The hotel has been running for a couple of years, and they still have their local celebrities from the 90's on posters, part of the hotel's charm. We did not visit the hotel's spa and pool section. The hotel offers a shuttle service, and there is also a bus stop right outside the hotel with free buses throughout the val gardena in summer for easy access to all sites.

“Great food but no internet signal in the room”,"The hotel is a strange mix. The service and food were excellent. The staff were friendly and very helpful and, as we had an early start, breakfast was served especially early for us. However, the rooms are tired and really weren't cleaned properly. There were hairs all over the bathroom. Perhaps a new cleaner is required (or new glasses for the existing one)? The sauna was good (and free). Towels and dressing gowns were provided. It puzzled me that there was a hairdryer above the loungers by the sauna but later, when I searched for one in my room to no avail, I wished I had showered downstairs. The hotel provides shower gel/shampoo in a dispenser. The spa shuts at 18.30 which seemed a little early for people who like to be able to enjoy a full day in the mountains and then a bit of apres ski before returning to the hotel. There was no wifi signal in our room, only in the bar and restaurant areas. Luckily, we were there on a Saturday night so email/internet access wasn't too important but given that we had stayed in mountain refuges with faultless internet access during the week, it was strange that this hotel couldn't manage to extend the signal a few metres. I didn't sleep well owing to a stupidly hard and large pillow which gave me a crick in my neck! I awoke at 2am because of this and could hear the boom boom of music from the party below. I found it hard to get back to sleep. They were still partying at 5am. The hotel did not benefit from the late afternoon sun. We would have been better staying up on the slopes for this. I would definitely return here for dinner, as the food and the service were superb, bit I don't think I would stay overnight in this hotel again.",couple,NEG
“Problems”,"We decided on our stay at the Garden Hotel once already in Ortisei, so we didn't have much time to review other possibilities. That said, we were mildly disappointed with our stay. Positives: Attractive, quiet location. Up the hill from the town center, the views were lovely, and we enjoyed the quaintness of the surrounding area. Ortisei is gorgeous, especially in the springtime, and the hotel is positioned on the edge of Ortisei and takes advantage of the spectacular views of mountains, hillsides and the city beyond. The room we stayed in (mid-level) was quite large and had a balcony shared by one other room (I only saw the other guests once though). The indoor pool is pleasant and the seating around the pool is comfortable as the large windows allow you to take some sun. Negatives: As in the other review on the hotel, management is quite unfriendly. We booked the hotel 5 minutes before arriving, asking for half board (just breakfast). When we changed our mind upon arrival, deciding that we wanted dinner, we were told that it was too late to ask for the full board for the evening (we arrived at about 6pm). We also had a problem with the heating in the room which didnt seem to be working properly. The beds were covered by 2 separate small (twin-size) down comforters We had to resort to spending a night sleeping in our sweaters. My boyfriend, who is 6'1"""" had more problems than I did, as the comforter didn't even cover him, much less """"comfort"""" him. We asked that the problem be addressed the following day, and were told someone would come by. Unfortunately, it took a 2nd """"reminder"""" call to finally get assistance. They provided us with a small space heater (which did the job). Dinner was okay. Nothing special. I would say that it was worth the additional price, especially as there was only one! restaurant open in town for dinner. We would definitely not recommend the hotel, especially as there are so many other better ones in and around Ortisei.",couple,NEG
“A Garni in disguise”,"This hotel is rated a 4 star but it is seriously lacking in sophistication. We are well seasoned travelers who only stay in 4 or 5 star hotels. We booked 1 month in advance for our last minute christmas trip and wondered why such a highly rated hotel with such qualified staff was still available... quickly found out when we reached the place. The """"owner"""" is the son of the former owners, and trying to raise the stars by adding new amenities every year since his takeover 3 yrs ago, BUT is clearly not cut out for attending to high end clients. He made an art of offending guests over and over again. He said many times, if he does it for one guest he must do it for all guests!!?? I must say, the accomodations are clean and the seasonal staff employed is adaquate. The """"seasonal staff"""" has really been the only highmark on the hotel... after all, one should expect a very clean room for over $600 a night. The rooms and the view are not spectacular. The food is okay. The hotel is quite far-- 28 minutes walking distance from the town center (not 5 minutes as they suggested-- we timed it) The problems occur continuously when dealing with the hotelier... Overall, the feeling is very negative from him.. as though he has an inferiority complex. .Here are a few of the many issues we had with him.. he allowed us to make an appointment to have the shuttle service pick our children up after ski school (this is a common service for most hotels in the valley) but then did not pick them up until we called 30 min later, saying they do not make appoinments, but we should call when we are ready. I called in an urgent situation and asked for my husband,he said my husband was outside, when I suggested he walk out the front door get him, he gave the phone to his secretary, suddenly unable to understand English. He would not give me the number to the local kindergarten, I had to get it myself. He insisted the water in the hot tub should remain the same temperature when we suggested it was a little cool (even wrote down the temperature on a paper for our benefit saying it is always the same... which did not make it any warmer) . When, on our first night there, we called for shuttle pickup, he said we were a half hour late for pick up, but they would do it anyway because the shuttle service was already out (nice)... then the next day, he pointed out that we should not call again for shuttle pick up after the appointed time because they would not pick us up again. He had a yelling match with 2 different guests in our presence. I suggested, after several of these events in the FIRST FEW HOURS of our stay, that he did not seem happy to gave us as guests, he argued with us that we should not ask for the sauna to be turned up or call after the shuttle service is concluded for the day.-- This was a similar response to the yelling match he had with another of the guests. To me this all points to the fact that he is not the kind of host one should hope for when paying for a 4 star (US 5 Star) hotel who are expecting a high quality experience. I could go on and on about how unfortunate our stay has been, but the one thing I will say is that I wold never recomend this place to any one. This hotelier needs a wake up call... it is truly a garni with some fancy wrapping paper disguise. Too unfortunate.",family,NEG
“A Very Comfortable Hotel”,"The Col Alto is at the top of its game for ski resort hotels, though it has to be said that it's in a village that is up to its neck in sumptuous hotels! We had a mini suite in the new part of the hotel, which is connected to the old via an underground corridor: this can be a bit of a drag depending on how you're feeling, (the ski locker is located in the old building) and is the reason I've given only 4* and not 5. However a plus point is that it is possible to ski back to the hotel for all but novice skiers. The Ice bar is a small but can be quite a bustling place, and they serve some fantastic tapas style tasters with drinks. The Spa area is huge, and has a good sized pool as well as the usual 'wellness' elements. Our room was large, handsomely decorated, had a big balcony with an outstanding view of the 'Old Hotel' and the Col Alt mountain behind, and a bathroom even men would be impressed by! The food in the hotel was of a very high standard: a huge choice for a buffet style breakfast; and some of the evening dishes were inspired. The wine list was good, but pricey for us poor Brits with the Euro at 1.12 at the time. As for Corvara, whilst not stupidly expensive, it is far from being a cheap resort: an average beer is 7 Euro and a bottle of Prosecco 20-25 E, though I have to say that the many good mountain restaurants are relatively good value. As Has been mentioned elsewhere this is not 'club central', so if you want table thumping nightlife.................try Austria.",couple,NEG
"“Corvara is the place to ski in the Italian Alps, Col Alto is the place to stay”","While there are many places to choose from for a ski vacation, I ended up in Corvara in the Italian Alps and there is no better place to stay than Hotel Col Alto. As a way of background, the Dolomiti Superski Area consists of 12 ski resorts, 450 lifts, and 1,220 km of slopes - all on one reasonably priced lift ticket (38 Euros to 48 Euros). Cortina D'Amprezzo may be the most well known of the 12 resorts. However, drive 40 minutes north from Cortina on the breathtaking Grande Strada delle Dolomiti or Great Dolomite Road or drive an hour east from the German speaking Italian town of Bolzano on the same road, and one hits the resort of Alta Badia and the town of Corvara. While it is neither the winter retreat of choice for fashionistas from Milan or Rome nor has it hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics like Cortina, Corvara offers something else which may be even more valuable in this day and age: an authentic ski vacation. And no place embodies it more than the Hotel Col Alto. Hotel La Perla which is up the road may be on the Leading Hotels of the World, but Hotel Col Alto makes you feel like you were given a key to a room in your friend or family member's home: i.e. service is great and more importantly genuinely responsive if requested especially relative to other regions in Italy. But most appreciated was how the staff at Hotel Col Alto learned that this traveler just wanted to be left alone to use all their facilities - the game room, swimming pool, and one of the best spas with a jacuzzi, athletic foot massage, heated stone recliners/water beds, and count it 5 different steam rooms/saunas and they complied. With their newly renovated bar Iceberg and their central location in Corvara, Hotel Col Alto has also become the place to be at night. With a name stemming from the famous drinks spot on Bondi Beach in Sydney and an interior reminiscent of Apotheke in New York, Iceberg combines the best of nightlife from around the world with the traditions of this German-Austrian-Italian region. When looking for other places to go out at night, our group invariably ended up back at Iceberg almost every night at the end of the night. If not, it was to pass out back in the hotel room from a long day of skiing and apres ski activities. All in all, even as I continue to explore the world and try out different ski resorts from all areas of the world, I will say this. Corvara and specifically Col Alto is a place that I will return - which for me is one of the highest forms of recommendations I can give. And if Corvara and Col Alto continue to remain under the radar, all the better for me when I return.

The staff -from waiters to owners- was 100% available and adorable, ready to answer any questions and to help us appreciate every minute in Corvara. My report wouldn't be complete if I forgot to mention the great after-ski spa and the delicious Italian food.

"“Once you've been there once, you'll keep coming back!”","If you are looking for European charm / family-run business, combined with US-style efficiency and service quality, the Hotel Col Alto is the place for you. I've been going to the Hotel Col Alto every winter since childhood, whilst also adding ski weeks across most of Europe (St Anton, Crans Montana, Megeve, Verbier, etc) and Canada; Corvara remains my favourite ski resort due to the variety and quality of the slopes, combined with wonderful refuges on top of the mountains where you can enjoy top quality food and wine for lunch, as well as the best après-ski at L Murin. And the Hotel Col Alto remains my favourite hotel due to a combination of traditional and very welcoming hospitality, great cuisine, very relaxing wellness centre with sauna, multiple steam rooms, swimming pool. What makes the real difference at the Hotel Col Alto is the ownership (who also runs the hotel), as they are fully dedicated to make your holiday as relaxing and enjoyable as possible, and also are relentlessly thinking of new ways to continuously improve the experience for their clients -- once you've been there once, you'll keep coming back!",None,POS

“Excellent hotel in a great resort”,"Very efficient and welcoming staff. Contemporary reception and lounge with a very unique bar. Food and service very good. Spacious bedrooms with plenty of storage and hangers. One minor negative is the old fashioned wall mounted hair dryer in the bathroom.

There is also a great spa and wellness area for relaxing after a long day skiing. The hotel provides a free shuttle bus to the ski lifts and also lockable, heated ski lockers.

“Good in Parts!”,"I found out about Bolzano from the design hotel website. It is somewhat of a hidden jewel of a city, tucked away in the Domomites with relatively few UK visitors. Needless to say I did not choose their Hotel Greif as I wanted a hotel with an outdoor pool and as the weather for the third week in August was consistantly 34 degrees this was a wise choice! First impressions of the Scala Stiegl are underwheming - reception is small and dominated by a lift to take the disabled to its restaurant. Reception staff are very helpful, hard working and are keen to please. I booked a superior room - probably not worth the extra money, the promise of a marble bathroom turned out to be marble plastic tiles. The king size bed was 2 singles pushed together - the balcony had no furniture, and the furnishing did not seem to match! Breakfast has a good range of fresh fruit, cheese, hams, yogert and breads - freshly brewed coffee and juices. Service is efficient. Breakfast can be taken outside in the garden. The hotel's best asset is the outdoor pool and garden - a pleasure to sit in and lots of sun beds. Bolzano can be reached via a flight to Verona - short bus ride (5 euros) to the station and then a 2 hour / 1 1/2 hour train ride depending on whether a regional or intercity train is taken. (Cost is 9.30 or 14.50 euros). The hotel is afew minutes walk from the station. So this is 'do-able' for a long weekend. In this area of Italy they speak Italian and German - the city is very clean. Its worth exploring with a good range of up market shops, and lots of opportunities to take cable car trips to mountain villages. There is one cable car station just round the corner from the hotel which takes you to Sopra Bolzano or Ober Bozen - Above Bolzano - the views are great and it costs just 3.90 return. (Next to the cable car station is a strange Aldi/Lidl type supermarket called Euro Spin - its the nearest supermarket to the hotel and sells cheap drinks including water.) BEWARE - ALL SHOPS CLOSE ON SUNDAY! If you visit the, city - vist a bar called Fischbanke - a phantasy bar (Dr Steiter Strasse) is a must - try the Veneziano cocktail - a mixture of Aperol (orange liquor and prosecco).

“The substitute proved a winner!”,"We had never heard of this hotel when we planned our trip to Bolzano! The plan was to stay at the Four Points Sheraton for a one night stopover on our way to Cortina. However when we arrived, there had been a fire at the Sheraton so they booked us into the Scala in town. My initial reaction was disappointment as the Sheraton looked good and the Scala looked much older. But when we calmed down, we realised we had free outdoor parking (20 euro at Sheraton), free breakfast, and a great location in town. We probably would not have bothered going into Bolzano from the Sheraton, and would have missed a wonderful old world town centre. It also meant on the day we left, we were able to visit the """"Iceman"""" museum which was a bonus. So in the morning, having a good breakfast, in a pretty garden, warm and under a big umbrella, near to the swimming pool, we decided that fate had smiled kindly on us.

“Alpenland Hotel Rodeneggerhof”,"What a wonderful setting for this family-run hotel in the Dolomites. Set at the end of a road through the village the hotel is rated as three star but comes perilously close to achieving four. The hotel owner is the chef and his wife, sister, mother and children who all help in the running of the business with admirable success. The rooms are delightful and are accessed on the two upper floors by a lift or short flight staircases. The main restaurant is on the ground floor with several other adjacent areas set out as additional seating accommodation and a central bar area. Free wifi is available in this location but not in the rooms. The varied menu in the restaurant was buffet style at breakfast with a somewhat limited range of cereals, cold hams and sausage, etc., cheeses and lovely fresh rolls, bread and croissants obtained early morning by the hotel owner himself. Evening dinner was served at the table with four courses available every night. All food was of a very high standard. The rooms themselves are, in the main, similar. Our room was of ample size with roomy, modern en suite shower and toilet facilities. The furniture was solidly wooden and germanic in style. The crowning glory was provided by the superb, all-round views from three separate windows which served the room. One floor-to-ground window gave access to a small but adequate balcony with table and chairs. The centre of the three windows was set higher from the floor and was in an alcove which contained a two-seater settee. So often do hotels only provide one chair in a twin room but this is not so at the Alpenland Rodeneggerhof. There is a fine medieval castle nearby and the inevitable village church which sounds a chime or two or three on each quarter hour with full blown chimes to mark each hour throughout the day. The latter are loud but do not commence until six a.m. although they are heard hourly until late evening! During the week my wife became disabled and was virtually confined to the room but the service and attention of the hotel proprietor, who called in a local doctor, and the assistance of all the staff was excellent.

Would have been nice to have hot food on a couple of mornings perhaps. Delightful village setting, though not a lot to do which didn't matter to our group as we were out on excursions every day.

This is a fabulous, family-run hotel and the owners went the extra mile to make our stay thoroughly enjoyable (it was like being welcomed into their home). The hotel is very clean and comfortable, the décor modern but understated, the food is excellent, the service is very helpful and attentive and there are distant views from every room. There were some very nice touches thrown in by the family to make our stay even better than the brochure suggested (eg gluhwein and cake on Boxing Day afternoon, little presents on the dining tables for everyone on Christmas Eve and, of course, a special last-night opening of the Lucky Nugget saloon after dinner when Marcus accompanied the music on his own set of drums). Highly recommended.",couple,POS

The hotel has a very nice wellness center with a small pool, steam room, dry saunas, and comfortable lounge chairs (open from 4-7). Rooms are very nice and clean. If you are traveling with children, this place is really amazing! They have a small play area outside with a swing set, sand box, and trampoline and there is also a very nice playroom with toys in the main building where dinner is served (This was perfect as there are several courses at dinner and we could take our 1.5 year old in the playroom when she was tired of sitting at the table). The staff were all very kind and the woman that owns the place is incredibly elegant and genuinely nice. Hotel Kabis definitely contributed to my vacation in the Dolomites being one of the best my family and I have ever had! It helped reminded me that magical moments are still there to be had.

These staff know how to look after their guests - other hotels we visited could do well to send their people here for training to find out how it's done properly. We left very early on our last day, having no expectation that anyone would be up at such an early hour but they were not only up, but ready to help with our luggage and provide coffee before we left. The location of the hotel is great - just a short walk to the beautiful old town centre.

There is wood everywhere, the rooms are quite comfortable with double windows. Breakfast on a terrace overlooking the garden, the mountains and a pleasant small square is enchanting.

Staying at Hotel Elephant is an experience! There is a feel of the Grand Tour, of a refined tourism """"far from the madding crowd"""", of permeating sense of authentic refinement which invites slowing down. The location is ideal, just minutes from the heart of the charming historic center of Brixen - truly a delightful town. The Christmas Market was enchanting in the picturesque main square. I have had the luxury of extensive travel and rate Hotel Elephant among the finest hotels where I have had the privilege of staying: our Comfort (basic) room are beautifully set up with attention to traveler's needs, the bathroom was lovely with floor heating and thick, soft towels. Our mattresses were first rate (I mention this since one reviewer mentioned them) and extremely comfortable. I cannot fault Hotel Elephant in any way.

The hospitality is open, welcoming and genuine. Service is professional, attentive and knowledgeable. The hotel also houses a superb restaurant, and again ambience and service would be hard to match.

“Ideal base for ski touring val Gardena with your family”,"I have just spent a week in this charming little hotel in the outskirts of Ortisei/St Ulrich with my teenage daughter. Even I have been in this hotel several times, it is always a joy to come back Here is my feedback and the reasons behind my review: - exquisite food. The dinners are an absolute feast for the gourmet! The portions are not big, but I found that for me is a welcome respite from the polenta based megalunches I have in the Rifugi on the slopes... - It is a family run hotel, and the constant presence of the owners ensure a meticulous attention to quality, and at the same time contributes to the overall informal and pleasant ambiance. This explains the large number of regular customers we meet year after year. - The hotel is within walking distance to the centre of the village, and there is a safe walking path to reach Ortisei in 10-15 (pram friendly, for families with small babies). My daughter could walk to the village to meet her friends without excessive concerns by her anxious father... - to get to the slopes, if you do not have a car, you have to rely on the hotel shuttle. The service is efficient, but they take you only to Ortisei. If you want to get to other parts of the valley, you have to take public transport. Of course from Ortisei itself you can ski all across Val Gardena, but it may take a little time to get to the upper slopes of the valley.",family,POS

The ski room was heated and all our gear dried well overnight. A free shuttle bus was at our disposal to drive us to the village/ski lifts. We also made use of the small wellness centre with showers/sauna and spal. This area was warm/clean with plenty of towels and changing areas. The meals were excellent, plenty of options at breakfast including freshly cooked eggs/bacon/omelettes and a good variety of evening meals (3 menus to choose with minimum of 5 dishes) with great desserts. We always felt welcome and comfortable in the communal areas of the hotel even with the children around. We would definitely return to this hotel",family,POS
“Real gem in Ortisei”,"The three of us (two adults and one 9 yo) stayed at this hotel in October 2008. We had not been to the area before and were very pleasantly surprised by Ortisei and surrounding towns. The Hotel Hartmann is on a rise on the main road out of town towards St Christina. It is around 700 metres from the centre of Ortisei – nice downhill walk into town but then uphill on the way back! The hotel overlooks the village and we were able to see it from our balcony. Some rooms looked to have better views of the village than others so a specific request to the hotel would be appropriate if that matters to you. The room was very clean and well maintained. It looked to have been recently renovated in light pine and white and greenish colours. The bed was comfortable with big thick doonas/quilts which would be lovely in winter. We had pretty good weather so did not really need them but it was no trouble to get a sheet. Breakfast included breads, jams/spreads, cereals, ham, cheese, cakes and so on. It was pretty quiet when we were there but we still seemed to get a reasonable array of food. The hotel restaurant was closed for dinner when we were there so if you specifically want to eat there, then contact the hotel as it was not clear to me that the restaurant would be closed when I booked. That said, the owners also run a restaurant in town called Restaurant Antica Osteria Traube. As guests in the hotel, you can get a special rate for dinner and it is so worth it! We ate there four times – the food was fantastic and the people very friendly. The menu is only in Italian and German but don't let that stop you! We were able to get some help in translation from one of the friendly chefs. There is a small kids’ menu (chicken and chips or pasta) but my daughter was very happy with that! After we’d eaten there two nights and she’d had chicken and chips each time, the chef came out and asked if she’d prefer steak! This restaurant was a real stand-out on our 8 week trip in Italy. We drove into town to eat and it was easy to park but this might not always be the case in peak times. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. They were welcoming and keen to make sure we had everything we needed. I was a bit worried when we first checked in as we were the only guests for some of the nights but there was no issue at all – if anything they were more attentive! We can highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again. If you are in Ortisei, make sure you do the gondola with the red cars as the view on the other side of the mountain is just extraordinary. We went up three times!! Other places we visited as day trips included Lake Garda, Lake Dobbiaco (including a short visit to Austria just to go to two countries in one day – what can I say, when you are from Australia, it’s a novelty…), the various “Passos” – Passo Sella and Passo Falzarego are absolute standouts.

“wonderful place but...”,"We stayed for five nights in this wonderful resort. The room was beautiful, the wifi worked perfectly, and we spent plenty of time in the pool. BUT both restaurants were a disappointment. We had two meals at the Stube but they were never able to synchronize service. Sometimes one guest would be finished with a dish before the other received his; it made for some awkward moments and lots of glances toward the wait staff who tended to disappear rather than try to answer our questions as to why both desserts couldn't come out at the same time... In addition enjoying a great breakfast buffet every morning in Ristorante 1500, we also visited the restaurant on two evenings for dinner. The first visit did not go well. The food wasn't special and the service was so-so. But on our last evening we enjoyed an excellent dinner and excellent service. So maybe the problem is that the restaurant needs to work on making sure that every meal is like that last one we appreciated. Options for hiking around the resort (without having to move your automobile which is parked in the garage down where the cable car station is located) are pretty limited. This is a great place for taking a 3-5 day break with a little hiking and a lot of relax. If you want the splendors of mountain hiking, you'd do better to consider going someplace across the border in Switzerland.",couple,NEG
"“Lovely public rooms, good restaurant, bedrooms nothing special”","The Hotel Elephant sits in the middle of Bressanone which like the hotel is nice but nothing special. The public rooms in the hotel are beautiful and it is nice staying in an authentically old inn. The public rooms are filled with interesting art and antique furniture. The negative is that, like so many hotels, the bedrooms are dull and not interesting. They couldn't have been less imaginative in putting together their bedrooms. The restaurant was surprisingly good serving Tyrolean cuisine. The gardens were nice but I would say that the swimming pool was like the bedrooms--not memorable and not a feature. If you are coming from far away I would stay in Ortisei, not Bressanone or I would stay in a hotel like the Rosa Alpina instead of the Hotel Elephant. Again, it's not that the hotel is a charmless, unenjoyable place--it just isn't special.",None,NEG

“Charm and Elegance”,"This hotel is simply stunning. It starts from the first moment you walk in to the second you leave. You are made to feel special by the most polite and professional staff I have ever come across in my frequent travels. The 450 plus year old is designed with a fun and dignified Elephant motif throughout and numerous art works, antique furniture and historic displays throughout the hotel. No two rooms are alike and yes the rooms aren’t as glamorous as some upscale hotels they have something else called character. You are paying a very reasonable price for a real experience in history and elegance. The hotel is right on the edge of a stunning walking district and the restaurant food was of a very high quality if not a bit pricey. There is even a higher quality fine dining option in the same compound that will suit travellers who are looking for simply the best. Secure parking and internet is available for an extra fee which is always a little disappointing to spoiled western travels. The breakfast buffet which was included was so fresh and well presented you couldn’t help but feel special, and yes it was the standard continental layout. While I was just passing through as an overnight stop I plan on returning for a night or two with my wife as it would make a wonderful get away and perfect base of operations to explore the stunning region.

The room itself is rather small with queensize beds which was less than we expected. But this was our only complaint. The design of the building is awesome, the staff is friendly and the spa area is quite big and was at least during the day not too crowded. The best part of the hotel is for sure the restaurant """"1500"""" that serves extraordinary food. We also got lucky to be served by Angelo, in our opinion the best waiter of the hotel. The location is perfect if you are looking for a relaxing holiday as the hotel can only be reached by cable car and the area does not seem to be flooded by day tourists.

Eager to go for the newest resorts and hotels worldwide, this hotels keeps catering us in the best possible and warm way. The modern architecture by Matteo Thun remains timeless in its beauty. The staff is excellent (watch out for Georges, he is a true top maitre d'hotel and very professional, and Andy, probably the most sympathetic sports manager on earth ... ). The culinary level is reasonable with a basic offer in the stube Ida and a higher level in the 1500 restaurant (although sometimes a little bit to far fetched and not always up to the level of the credentials of the chef). the rooms remain beautiful in their modern, minimal simplicity.

My husband and I have travelled widely for more than 30 years and stayed in modest, as well as luxury hotels all over Europe, and especially in Italy, where we live. Stating that """"we have no wifi, as we would like our guest to relax comepletely"""" comes across as simply patronising, confusing bad service with good (who decides what is relaxing?). The cable supplied instead did not work, reception staff adamantly maintaining it wasn't their fault. The same reception staff was ignorant of even the names of common Italian newspapers, did not get us promised newspapers (The Guardian and Financial Times not available), and did not take Diners Credit Card although stated in brochures and on website. The special 3-days weekend offer stated in the information folder in the room gave a price of 883.- Euro, which meant we payed between 400 and 500 Euros for one extra night... Waitress in the 'Stube' restaurant argued (in the literal sense of the word) that it didn't matter if white wines and rosé wines were older, and in the breakfast room the head waiter - when his attention was drawn to the pitiful morsels of cheese displayed - made it clear I was being unreasonable and asked: """"And what cheese would you like then?"""". We also overheard a young couple being turned out of the 'Stube' restaurant one evening, when they asked for a table without having reserved. """"No, we have reached our limit, I'm sorry!"""" (showing no sign of this by the way). There were still empty, non reserved tables, and the couple were guests in the hotel, with nowhere else to go for a meal after 7.30 pm, as the cable car stops working at that hour. Why the toilet was a tiny cubicle with neither hand wash facility, nor bidet, beats me. Nostalgia for old farm loos perhaps?

“Felt like I was in Wallpaper magazine”,"Vigilius is the kind of resort / hotel that you find featured in upmarket design / architecture magazines. The place is gorgeous. The location is exclusive. The views breathtaking. The staff were friendly and helpful. We loved our room and its design. Very modern but at the same time warm and cosy. The website of Viligius has photographs. Trust me, the room looks like that in real life. You will not be disappointed. The hallways were a bit creepy. Long, empty with red carpets. Given that the place was not too crowded at the time and the mountain setting, I could not help but think of the movie """"The Shining"""". That being said, my wife and I loved the place. It was by far the best hotel we stayed in. The food was great. The breakfast was good. Not breathtaking in scope, just good quality food. During lunch, the IDA Studa is opened. I liked the food there. Wholesome (if slightly heavy) Austrian / German fare. They serve tea (at about 4 pm) and pre-dinner drinks (at about 6ish). During dinner, the restaurant, 1500, is fantastic (albeit slightly pricey). We didn't take the spa treatments. The pool, sauna and steamroom were however well maintained and very pretty (especially the pool and the connected outdoor jacuzzi). Various activities (i.e. exercise classes, massage try-outs, etc..) are schedule through the day to keep you occupied if you want. There is no tv in the room (which I think was great) unless you request for one. Instead, there is a library / reading room where they show movies at night and where there is a projector / tv thing that you can use in the day. They also provide a pc (with internet connection) and a printer for free. The main activity that we took part in was skiing. They arranged for equipment (skis, boots, poles) and an instructor. The chair lift is literally less than 100 m from the hotel. The slopes were very basic and empty (which was great for my wife and I as it was our first time skiing). Take note however that the hotel does not provide / rent ski clothes. You will therefore have to bring your own or (like us) buy some in town (a 10 minute cablecar ride and a 15 minute walk away). That being said, if you are considering staying there, there are a few things you should note. First, the view and the design come with a price. Check with the hotel to see whether you can get a deal. They have them from time to time. Second,If you're driving, park at the cable car station. The hotel will arrange for parking. If you do not drive, the hotel can arrange for a cab to pick you up. From what I noted, there is no train station near the cable car station and the bus stop was a 5 minute up hill walk away.

“Above the clouds - can be pretty comfortable”,"Travellers - this place has three characteristics that are amazing - this is why we went there and this is what will attract you to go there: - LOCATION The ride in the funicular - the way up, the setting, modern, designed, the views. The whole Hotel is build around the views, the rooms into the woods or down the hill, the spa view into the valley, the restaurant's views. The design and architecture team really capitalized on the location. Rarely seen something like that before. - ROOMS These are quite charmy with local wood used and an intersting way to separate wet room from bedroom. Something unusual. - FOOD, SERVICES As the hotel is small (40ish rooms or so) there is effectively a dual offering in food - the higher class restaurant with lots of local refined ingredients, and the Stube (local dishes). Works well for a week, beyond you like to move on a bit. Keep in mind on the various huts you go to during your hikes you will effectively get similar food like Stube, but more crudo, ! WHY NOT 5 STARS? Simply, its very expensive, and my kids (10 and 13) paid 270 Euro a room w breakfast, thats a lot. While I understand the economics (limited number of rooms, transportation cost, infrastructure up the hill, etc) I suggest to every traveller to go for a 3 days special price/package (ask!). SUMMARY A great stay, do 4-5 days, thats it, unless you are eager re the mountains. We had two wonderful hikes and 2 days in the valley with Reinhold Messner's castle and seeing Oetzi Museum and a day shopping. suggestions/critics welcome, drop me a mail.",family,NEG
"“Nice views, get me out of here”","The design of the building was what really attracted us. We are designophiles, as were many of the hotels patrons. If the fashionista set has a hotel circuit, this is likely one of them. The drawbacks however, are several and not insignificant. The first is location. You must arrive by car as the Italian railway system is notoriously unreliable in these remote areas so missing connections is a serious possibility. The other is size; it DOES matter, particularly when the weather isn't very good and all of the hotel patrons are crowded into the limited spa facilities. Which is surprising, because its main attraction is...the SPA! So why there is only room for six people to sit knee-to-knee, naked, in a small steam room is beyond me. Naturally, no one wants to sit knee to knee and naked with strangers, so they huddle in the sauna which accomodates six people, uncomfortably. The hotel has 41 rooms, at an average of 2 people per room, I dont understand where they expect everyone to go. There is no gym, just a room where there are one or two yoga-type classes daily. However, it snowed heavily the days we visited and we quickly ran out of things to do so i would suggest that they could use a few bikes, for those inclined to do more than sit in crowded sauna. The pool is very nice, with beautiful views. Noisy, as there are often children but lovely. The views from the rooms are spectacular and the quality of the rooms very high. Drawback; no glass or partition between the bed and sink area, slightly unromantic. The """"piazza"""" or lounge area is also somewhat small and décor disappointing; looks like an airport waiting room. It could be a lot more interesting with a few design accents (great lamp, interesting pillows) but is rather generic modern. The restaurant upstairs is excellent, we loved breakfast and dinner was always something interesting. Downstairs at the Stube one struggled to find anything that wouldnt settle like lead in the stomach, to no avail. If you are hungry during the day and snowed in, there are no alternatives. However, if you don't eat lard or sausage there is nothing on the menu one can eat. I was ravenous and angry at not being able to have lunch or a light snack during the day; this is a serious downside for healthy Spa patrons and management should address this shortcoming immediately. Fruit baskets in rooms are not replenished, but its a nice idea. Family friendly environment, screening room excellent idea otherwise nothing to do in evenings, a bit like retirement centre and sad. They should consider having a """"lounge"""" dj coming in at least on saturdays, not a sad harpist. We stayed away. After the snow, the overcrowded facilities and forced hunger during our stay, we were happy to leave after a long weekend. Three days is enough even for the most romantic couples (like us), perhaps more with children or when weather clears. One can take a lift up to the hills for a long walk or light ski which is pleasant and sporty -- if you're not a big skiier (i'm not), and great for children. Overall it was nice, but dont know that we'd do it again.",couple,NEG

“Floating above the clouds”,"What an amazing hotel. This is my second visit to the Vigilius after staying earlier in the year, I couldn't get back soon enough. On both occasions I have been made very welcome, as an English man who can speak no German I have found all the staff very helpful and willing to make my stay as pleasant as possible. The location is fantastic, you really do feel as though you are floating above the clouds with amazing views. Just taking a stroll around the surrounding countryside and you soon begin to unwind leaving all your stresses behind. If that doesn't work the superb hotel spa offers plenty of alternative ways to relax. Take time to try both restaurants the food and wine is superb. The peaceful and calm atmosphere of the Vigilius will ensure you will want to return year after year - just like me.",None,POS
“Luxury mountain retreat with amazing scenery”,"We stayed here after a trip to Venice for 3 nights and it was amazing. A real luxury hotel to treat yourself at, the design of the hotel is spectacular and the views even more so. The area surrounding the hotel is wonderful for walking and the routes are easy to follow. You can do a two hour walk followed by a lovely lunch in a mountain inn (the walk routes almost always pass one) and return to the hotel for a swim and sauna in the pool area. The two restaurants are the only point I have a criticism about, the more relaxed Ida is better value and cosy, with really good food. However, the other restaurant which proffers to be more 'fine dining' is very overpriced for what is served, we were quite disappointed. There are apparently some good restaurants in Lana and the cable car runs on the hour until 11pm, so that might be worth a try rather than the restaurant in the hotel. I would disagree with the reviewer who says Italian trains are unreliable. We took 4 trains in Italy, including from Verona to Bolzano to get to this hotel (the hotel booked a taxi to Lana, then cable car). All of our journeys were very pleasant and were booked beforehand on the trenitalia website which is brilliant, we had paperless tickets and you just get on with the paper print out. We travelled first class on all journeys which I would recommend because it isn't that expensive (a total of £150 for 4 journeys for 2 people in first class) and second class doesn't look that great. We drove from Milan to Sud Tyrol a couple of years ago and it was much nicer to get the train. The reason I have given 3 stars for value is because of the food issue above and also because we have stayed in this area before. The reason we come is for the amazing scenery and some lovely outdoor activities and walks. There are some much cheaper hotels in the area and although they are more basic the one we have stayed in was wonderful. You are paying for the extra luxuries here but if you just want access to some of Europe's most spectacular mountain scenery it can be done comfortably for cheaper.",couple,NEG

“A wonderful hotel - not a five star though...”,"I've just spent three nights at the Vigilius Mountain Resort in Lana with a couple of friends. We've had a wonderful relaxing time. Stunning views from our Deluxe Double. Very friendly service (But prepare to get up many times if you want to order something, find a waiter and then tell him/her what you want. The hotel was fully booked and chronically understaffed). The pool area, sauna etc. are small but very stylish. Food at """"Ida"""" the South Tyrolean Restaurant was okay, food at """"1500"""" restaurant fantastic. Service always with a smile. In the afternoon they offer free tea and in the evening complimentary drinks and snacks. All very nice. The rooms are nicely designed, they have no TV. I would not go for the best category again, since all rooms are the same and the views even from the cheaper categories are just as nice. Unfortunately, you can hear your nighbours when they turn on even quiet music or people walking by in front of your door. Otherwise the silence and the sounds of nature are stunning. I would defenitely go again, even though I think it's not a five star. I'd rate it a 4 star (not enough papers in the morning, lack in staff, no real room service, no gym, no W-Lan). P.S.: To the couple with two little kids from May 13 until May 16. Did you have fun? I hardly believe so. You had to tell your kids a hundred times to be quiet because that's what EVERYBODY else wanted at the resort. Your kids could not play, had no friends and no entertainment. There are many, many family hotels in South Tyrol. The Vigilius Mountain Resort is defenitely not one of them.",friends,NEG
“My private Fairy-tale”,"For a long time I have not experienced miracles, and even stopped believing in them, until I visited Vigilius this time in Feb 10. This was my second stay at this charming hotel. The property has tremendously improved in 2 years, and is close to none world-wide. I rarely write such positive reviews because spoiled as I am, I always find faults which only selected properties in Asia would be free from. It happens rarely, but is such a pleasure when a hotel overrides your expectations. What makes a nice difference is arriving off peak-season, which in Vigilius is the weekends and Christmas to NY. Almost all the weekends throughout a year the hotel is booked. So what was so special this time? The team of professional employees makes a huge difference. As we know the success of any company is the people working for it. Last November I have been to Alila Cha-Am - property of breakthrough design, however absence of professionalism made me leave the hotel earlier than expected. The hotel stuff in 99,9 percent is just perfect. They speak at least three languages, can talk about culture, have nice education, are good looking and are polite. And you can feel that the inner warmth comes from them, and it is not that they just want to squeeze the money out of you. This is such a rarity these days, and a new trend for this century, as Sarcozi has mentioned at the conference in Davos, the days of Anglo-Saxon way of leading business and only seeing profit as a success of a company are over. At Vigilius they are very honest, and I never had a feeling they want to squeeze money out of you. This is such a rarity these days still. Even though if you are still counting money hard, it is probably the other resort which would drive your attention, because Vigilius is not cheep. In the average you pay Eur 330 for a room a day (for 2) + 150 for eating and drinking (for 2, twice a day, but this is minimum) + 100 for a spa treatment ( for one, 60 minutes) + this and that. The superior rooms comes on the average 20 Eur less expensive then deluxe, the interior of both of them is the same, however the deluxe offers more privacy, no noise of others walking by your door, and better views. I even have my preferred room in the hotel, which I will not share with you since it is booked most of the time anyhow, however you will discover upon the arrival that not all the rooms are the same because of their location. The recommendation is not simply to book the room, but after that to get in contact with the hotel asking for some hint and tips, so that they are prepared for your arrival in advance. Also spa treatments (if you want to have them 4 pm to 7 pm) are best to be booked in advance. They have 4 therapists, which means scarcity has to live, because therapists have their ares of differentiation. And it is good like that, however spa is the only area which needs improvement. The products they work with are in a way outdated and from a last century - like Thalgo and Shiseido which you can get anywhere in Duty Free. Newly introduced Sodashi sounds trendy Japanese, however is Australian and smells horribly synthetic even though the promise is to be natural. They need some introduction of The Organic Pharmacy, Elemis, Aveda, BioCol, Valmont - something nice. The quality of treatments is good, but not excellent. They try hard, but it fails in comparison to top spas - like Six Senses for example. My favourite therapist was Claudia, she can not hear, but is a very nice person, dedicated to her job. She can be sometimes close to obsessive-compulsive, however it is good for the Clients. I liked it, lets put it like that. The other therapists include Elisabeth, who is bit older and a bit spooky, and you can feel during the treatment that her life is not a piece of cake, and she has some issues. However she is the only one who knows Yoga massage. Another one is the girl from Slovak, who is young and energetic, and can give a good pressure. However Shiatsu was not like the one you get at Como Shambala resorts on Bali. The spa should definitely bring some therapists from Asia. The treatments as I said were good, but the aftereffect did not last long. Still you need the treatments, because what else to do before the dinner if you are not on the honeymoon? The SPA area is great, the pool, the sauna, the outdoor whirlpool among pine trees. The hotel gusts know how to behave and would normally not enter sauna, if more than two people are already there. The 1500. Perfect food and service, huge improvement over the last two years. Portions are just right. Not too small Like Hotel Omm in Barcelona, still the taste makes me think they would one day go for Michelin awards (if they do not spoil). The waiters do everything correctly, they never mistake orders, bring it at the right time, keeping the pauses, are good with wine recos, not simply trying to sell you the most expensive one. Not all the tables, just like the rooms are the same, so watch in the morning which table you would like to have in the evening, and reserve it immediately. The guests prefer to reserve the table they like for the whole stay. Stube Ida. Excellent food. prices twice cheaper than 1500. There is only one BUT. BARBARA her name is. I could write a novel about her, but then I understood that this is simply the hotel strategy. They keep Barbara at Ida, so that more people go to 1500 restaurant, because all the waiters rotate but Barbara never works upstairs. She is very efficient but...You will see...However all the places need a black sheep, because at least there is somebody to discuss..... And then we come to my favourite time spending - Sports. Andreas is in charge of Sports Section, and knows all the trends which he introduces every year. Two years ago it was Pilates and this year i found The Five Tibetans. It was marvelous. Besides I took him for private ski lessons, and he was very good. Very patient, very friendly and charismatic personality, motivating. Andreas is a hidden tip, he made my stay additionally enjoyable. Book him privately, and he will deliver! Reception. Very friendly, very helpful. Just nice. They give you hints and directions and can even sell cigarettes late night, and triple check that you are doing fine. There is a good selection of ski equipment which you can rent downstairs, but again request in advance. And then simply enjoy Vigilius, in a way it reminds me Oberoi Wildflower, but in Europe, and you do not need to fly to Himalaya. The nearby restaurant Sessellift is very nice for lunch (and you can escape Barbara!), very tasty, cheap for what they offer, and friendly. The guys helping with the elevators are very friendly too. A week will go like one day. The dress code at the hotel is smart-casual with the tendency to Armani-Zegna-Zanotti. The guests are Tyler Brulee like. Some have kids and teach them according Montessori system I guess. Because the kids are screaming like hell, and parents would not say one word. But those with the kids are a minority where fathers are German representatives of modern corporations, who have no taste and talk loud, and wives would be sublimating. Some guests bring dogs. Luckily the dogs are Tinkerbellish (the one of Paris Hilton). There are though some lonely women with bigger dogs... In general, this is the best hotel review I have written on the Tripadvisor, and they just deserve it, because Vigilius is one of a kind, and when I start thinking about it, the very warm feeling flows over me, it is simply a stunning resort! And I have booked it for the next year, maybe see you there? ;-)",couple,POS
“hidden gem in the mountains”,"Only reachable by cablecar in 1500m above sea level this place was a real retreat. The staff has this natural heartful friendlyness. They don't ask you every five minutes if you feel ok but they are always there when you need something. The rooms are very cool - designed by Matteo Thun but still very cozy with furniture from B&B, and a clay wall standing like a monolith in the middle of the room, separating the bed from the bathroom. They function as radiator when it's cold and they cool down the room when it's hot. This hotel is supposed to be the most environment-friendliest in Italy. We also loved the spa with its pool, filled with water from a close by mountainspring and a view into the alps over to the Dolomites. Great after a day of hiking around in this beautiful mountain area. Food was perfect at the Restaurant 1500 with a very light and creative mediterranian cuisine. We also enjoyed their vegetarian menu one evening and the great selection of wines offered with very good recommendations from the somelier. Two minor complaints though: The quality of the massages wasn't really that good for both my wife and me and we didn't want to book a second treatment. The service for breakfast was a complete desaster. We waited 5 minutes for someone to seat us then another ten minutes until somebody showed up to take our orders. One day my wifes cappucino finally was served when we were about finished with eating, the other day my green tee was a black one, the soft boiled egg arrived cold and uncooked, on the second try it came hot and hardboiled and the waitress had to inquire in the kitchen first, if they would be able to prepare us some plain toasted bread. But apart from that we were quite happy there and will certainly come back - the location is just unbeatable!",couple,POS
“An experience for all senses and Mother Nature as a backdrop.”,"We were told upon arrival that the philosophy of the team that created and of those who run this hideaway gem was to make their guests feel good in every sense. For sure they have succeeded in making us feel just that. Good, relaxed and being taken care off. This hotel is a concept. A concept brought forward by the owner(s) to the master architect (Matteo Thun) who translated his clients' brief into a masterpiece of ecological design. A harmonious synthesis of building elements happily married with the elements of Nature and those of the local traditions. Either you accept this minimalistic environment and this type of accommodation or you don't. If you are on the other side of things there are plenty of hotels in the area that can satisfy your need for luxury with golden door knobs. Do not bother to reach the cable car at the foot of the mountain to lift you up to the entrance of the hotel at an altitude of 1500 meters. You are wasting your time and money. For my companion and myself luxury is synonymous with harmony, simplicity, tranquility, cleanliness, attention to detail, smiling faces and ...the sound of birds early in the morning. This is why we chose this amazing place and that's why we hope to be able to come back.",couple,POS
“Great massage at an unreasonable price”,"I booked a massage at Rosa Alpina Wellness Centre on the recommendation of the local bike shop. It was excellent. Alexa was an experienced masseuse who found all the knots and tight areas in the muscles and used a lot of the right type of pressure to get rid of them. When it came to paying for the bill, I was kept waiting for about 15 minutes as no one seemed to know what to charge for this service. Finally the barman was instructed to ring up on his bar till €185 for the massage. I have had many massages in various establishments including other Relais Chateau hotels and paid at most less than half this price.",None,NEG
“MAGNIFICENT”,"Even though I consider myself a global traveler, I had not been to Italy, except for a day trip over from France many years ago. This visit to the South Tirol was an adventure I plan to repeat soon. Vigilius is unique in several respects and I must suggest that those who find it lacking in whatever it is they seek, probably did not do their research before booking it. As a mountain retreat, it is almost a given that one is not going to find entertainment for large groups, a dazzling night life with Disco and DJ, massive SPA facilities and other things you might find in a major high end hotel with 400 rooms. It is a weird contradiction that many travelers say they want quiet and peaceful isolation and then whine because they can't entertain themselves once they get to such a place. The appealing thing about Vigilius is its quiet isolation, small size (40 rooms), intimate atmosphere and brilliant design...not to mention 360 degree views that are enough to keep me stunned for at least a few days. Inside, the buildings are spacious and decor is understated, but super clean and well cared for. Compared to most hotels, I found the interior spaces wide open and friendly. Personal service is what you would expect from such a property. For example, I drink very little alcohol, except for a few glasses of wine at dinner, so my refreshment needs are usually Coke or lemonade. After my first request for a regular Coke with ice, I got a tall beer stein with Coke and ice and this was refilled without my ever asking again. A small matter, but the kind of care I appreciate. I asked for more pillows and got three more. I wasn't crazy about the first room I saw, so the desk person walked me to three more and let me choose. That is service I appreciate. Roaming the mountaintop can give you all the solace you wish. Meals are excellent and a little advance planning can take care of the lack of 24 hour food availability. For example, I knew that there was no unscheduled food service, so we brought some snacks with us, and thus had plenty to eat when the dining rooms were not open. Food in general was good and typical regional fare. Language was no problem as this is territory that has more German influence than Italian and so Italian is almost the third spoken language, maybe the fourth, with German, English, French and whatever being more common. Parking at the lower cable car station is difficult...typical again of the situation elsewhere in Italy and yes, getting there can be annoying and frustrating because the nearest real international airports, (Innsbruck in Austria, Munich, Germany, Milan or Venice Italy), are too far away to expect shuttle service and a hired car is costly and nerve-whacking, given driving habits in Italy. Our car was driven expertly by a friend from Germany who knew the area, so we were okay and found a place to park, then took a bus to the base station. The key here is to pack light and not have tons of baggage to lug on various transports. The last time I stayed in a mountain top hotel it was in the dead of winter and the old bunker-like building shuddered and shook in the fierce winds on a German peak. After dinner, the place shut down totally and was dark and cold until breakfast. This place, Vigilius, in summer was the opposite end of the comfort spectrum. It is not cheap and we stayed in another nearby hotel the first night for a fraction of the Vigilius price, but it is a worthwhile experience in these times when even the top brand chain hotels all seem to look and feel alike. If you go, plan your travel carefully. You can fly to any one of five international airports, (Zurich, Munich, Innsbruck, Milan, and Venice) and then rely on ground transport from there. I also strongly suggest booking a nearby hotel for the first (and perhaps the last) night in the area so that you are not forced to hurry and make the last cable car up the mountain.",None,POS
“Too noisy”,"We booked this hotel for 6 nights at the end of February. We had seen it highlighted in a book called """"Room for Romance"""". We assumed that it would be suitable for couples. On the first nigh the noise in the Grill was unbearable . It was school holidays but I feel that those of us who have grown up children should be able to dine in peace and quiet without children running around and the constant noise of electronic games. There should be a quiet area in the restaurant. We ate out most nights to be able to dine in a peaceful atmosphere. The pool was equally noisy and other guests left small children to splash while they went to the spa leaving me as babysitter. I wasn't able to use the Jacuzzi at all because it was permanently full of small children. I have rated the hotel highly purely because the staff service is exceptional . Everyone was courteous and very helpful. The shuttle bus drivers deserve a special mention for their excellent service and courtesy. I think that the hotel needs to promote itself to families and not to couples. My children are grown up. When they were small we went to noisy family hotels. However now I want peace and quiet and unfortunately this hotel was not able to provide that Room Tip: We were in the new section.

The hotel lived up to expectations providing five star services and food to match at all times. If you want a perfectly relaxing hotel for a break then the Rosa Alpina is ideal.

“top of the top”,"We spent a week at the Rosalpina in march. We stayed in other hotels as well but decided to go for this one this time. The service, from reception to the bar, room cleaning, ski service, breakfast etc was perfect. A real 5 star service with staff ready to go for the extra mile for the client. We had a junior suite, it was spacious and well decorated. The bathroom was also spacious with toilet separated from the shower. Nice view on the mountain, no noise coming from the main street below. The owner Paolo and his son Hugo were always around, greeting and chatting with guests. They invited us few times for a drink which was very nice. There was a corporate group staying at the hotel during our stay. We were a bit concerned about the noise but the hotel managed them well. The shuttle to the ski lift is less than a minute and always ready to go so no waste of time there. The breakfast is huge with cold and warm food, fruit, cakes, several types of honey, yogurth, breads etc. The breakfast room is also charming, full of light. The espresso coffee wasn't the best i ever had. In the evening, before and after dinner, there was always some live piano music. Perfect to make the ambience more lively. We had dinner at st hubertus one night. Taking everything into account (food, location, ambience, service etc) I decided this was my best dinner ever. Every course was presented as a work of art where perfection is considered normal. The food is sourced locally and it would be redundant to say how good it was. The staff had a fantastic timing and coordination. They were able to talk about every course in every detail fluently. I struggle to remember when I have had such a perfect service in a restaurant. The chef came to our table twice, at the beginning and at the end of the meal to ask for clarifications and feedback. Norbert's words were genuine and not just marketing. Again probably never had such a feeling. We had dinner at the wine and grill as well. In short we thought it was very good but at the same time outside the hotel there is a lot of competition on that type of food at similar prices and quality. The spa area is nice but a bit small especially at 6pm when everybody is back from the slopes. They told us the plan is to extend it. Another excellent point of the hotel is the type of crowd. No loud italian or german (or whatever) loud speaking/screaming. Also big variety of nationalities present.

Upon arrival, we were welcomed by a warm and friendly members of staff, from the Houseman, Receptionist, to even the Mr. Pizzanini (owner of the hotel). Our rooms were deluxe rooms with a separate living room, nice big walking dressing. The bathroom was large with a huge shower and separate bath tub. Lovely balcony too. Cleanliness of the room, well don't even need to talk about it, as it was spotless. Never any delays in cleaning services. They clean the room twice a day. The hotel itself is very large with several little areas to sit down, have tea or coffee, read a book. From the bar, the lounges, the terrace. Their food outlets are also very varied. You have the breakfast hall, the fondu lounge, the grill bar, and their 2 Star Michelin restaurant. so the options are there too. We dined several times in the Grill Bar, but also went there for a few pre dinner drinks too. The food was A1, top quality, the staff with their knowledge of foods, and wines was very good. the atmosphere is just right, not too noisy, not to quiet. There is an open kitchen, which allows you to see the staff working. An ABSOLUTE MUST: their desserts are amazing, but they have the Rosa Alpina ice cream (see picture) which is just to die for, home made (oh and when I mean home made, they make it on the day, and yes it does make a difference) vanilla ice cream, with caramelized pumpkin seeds, with pumpkin seed oil, just amazing!!!!! The reception staff are very helpful with getting any and all information that you need for Ski lessons, ski rentals, transfers and recommendations for outside dining.

“Faultless!”,"As a travel agent who is lucky enough to experience many luxury hotels i have high expectations and few hotels live up to them. However the Rosa Alpina exceeded every single one! I spent 4 nights there last week with my mother who stepped in, at the last moment, to accompany me and am trying to organise to go back in March with my husband as i loved it so much. The interior design is so pleasing on the eye. A really well done mix of traditional Tyrolean style, which is very pretty, with light unvarnished wood and neutral, contemporary furnishings and fabrics. They are updating and refurbishing all the time so nothing looks old or worn. The atmosphere is elegant and relaxed but not glitzy or glamorous. The staff are so friendly and couldn't be more eager to help and please you. When we called down to ask for our fire to be lit someone appeared within about 2 minutes! Equally when we had finished our dinner in the Michelin starred St Hubertus restaurant and wanted to take our petit-fours up to our room the waiter had them wrapped and up to our room before we had even left our table - i think he personally ran with them up 3 flights of stairs! The food is exquisite, regardless of which restaurant you eat in. Breakfast is in the Limonaia, a sunny light room in a typical Tyrolean style. There is a large choice of cereals, fruit, cheese, cold meats, pastries, cakes and breads to choose from and a chef will also prepare eggs, crepes and porridge as you like. The crepes and poached eggs were delicious. I really liked the relaxed and modern atmosphere of the Wine bar and grill. The service, wine recommendations and food were all excellent. You could happily eat here all week and not be bored! Their executive chef Norbert has earned their gastronomic restaurant St Hubertus 2 Michelin stars and it is rightly deserved. Every morsel was amazing! There are only 9 tables so you need to make sure you book in advance of your stay to get in here as it is not to be missed. The Daniela Steiner Spa is really incredible. The treatments and products they use are blissful and i would urge everyone to book something. Even if it is just an Essence of the Dolomites bath experience. We were treated to this as the arnica and almond oil was so soothing that after 3 days of skiing our legs didn't ache one bit the next day! The hotel is 300m from the Piz Sorega gondola which takes you up into the San Cassiano ski area and onwards to link with the Sella Ronda ski circuit. The hotel has a shuittle to run you up and back whenever you need it. The skiing is excellent. Probably best suited to intermediates as there are lots of blues and reds. There is plenty to keep you occupied in the San Cassiano and Corvara area for a few days and the Sella Ronda takes a whole day and is well worth giving it a go. You just need to make sure you leave early (before 9am is best) to avoid the bottleneck at Arabba and make sure you go clockwise with the sunshine. We had a great instructor called Simon from the Ski and Snowboard School Dolomites who i would recommend. The hotel can sort lessons out for you. I was staying at the hotel essentially to get to know the hotel and area so i can confidently recommend it to my clients and all i can say is that it was a real joy!

Mostly our choice were made, because of friendly atmosphere, great service and outstanding infrastracher what offers Hotel Chalet Tianes. The best thing about Hotel Chalet Tianes is that their services are improving every year and quality become better and better.

Beautiful rooms with tastefull furnishings characteristic of the region. Three excellent restaurants including the Michelin 2 star St. Hubertus, superb and very friendly service.

“Luxury in the Dolomites”,"We arrived here on January 1st, from Venice. It was somewhat expensive to get there because the buses were not working on the holiday. We had a taxi arranged from the train station in Bolzano, which cost an arm and a leg. The hotel was wonderful. They upgraded us to a suite, which was really big and had a nice fruit bowl and mini bar. We had dinner at St. Hubertus on the first night. This was my first Michelin 2 star restaurant and it was truly excellent. All the courses were delicious and they each were paired with a delicious wine, some of which were local wines. The hotel had a ski shuttle that dropped us off at the ski mountain and picked us up when we were finished. The spa area was really nice. We only used the swimming pool and the sauna. When we left, the hotel gave us a homemade strudel for the road that was incredibly delicious!",couple,POS

“Great Hotel & Staff but hefty price”,"Had a wonderful week of skiing in Alta Badia. Staff was very helpful. Room was nice despite constant overheating and loose showerhead incredibly annoying. Nice mountain view. You need a shuttle (provided freely by the hotel) to get to the pistes which should have been mentioned although not a big inconvenience. Spa area was very nice (13m pool, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi..) albeit very busy. The hotel is very family friendly so not ideal when travelling as a couple. We dined every night at the wine & grill restaurant where food and service were excellent. Menu is very diverse, amuse-bouches are out of this world with must haves being the chicken, the oven baked pizza (especially the truffle one) and the beef filetto with grilled foie gras. We have not tried the Michelin-starred St Hubertus restaurant. Main criticism is that the buffet breakfast is very poor (any hot breakfast is a supplement including eggs!!) and that the overall experience is tainted as it is a bit not only overpriced but also you don't always know how much you will be charged before you order anything (for instance when we arranged ski lessons through the hotel, we could not get the staff to tell us the cost, same applies to equipment rental). Overall was a great holiday and would definitely recommend and would go back myself. Room Tip: Our mountain view room was perfectly located. If travelling as a couple, maybe avoid being next to a...

St. hubertus is my favorite restaurant in the world, better than per se (nyc), le cinq (paris), gary danko (sf), etc. the closing party in may was out of this world. total of 6 michelin stars between the four chefs cooking. the rooms are very stylish, the food out of this world good. the pizza in the casual restaurant amazing. italian style and hospitality + german efficiency make this one of the best hotel's in the world. i love alta badia for both the off-piste skiing and road cycling. simply awesome.",couple,POS

“Excellent B&B for hiking in Alta Badia”,"In my recent hiking holiday in the Dolomites, staying at Garni Delta was an excellent all around experience. Manuela, Riccardo and Stephano were all totally friendly, particularly in view of my limited Italian speaking skills, and continually willing to help with hiking advice for this area. The accommodation was excellent in all respects from the food, to the bar service, and my room. The complimentary pass for the local ski lifts which get you quickly up into the mountains, allowing you to enjoy your hiking even more, was a valuable plus. The view from my room was superb. I would stay there again without hesitation and hope to do at the first opportunity. In particularly appeals to me in being away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Corvara but still very convenient for major highways, shopping, funivias, and restaurants.",None,POS
“Amazing Views”,"My only regret with this place is only staying one night. The rooms had an amazing view of the Dolomites and you could see the town in the distance. The place was a little difficult for us to find but that was because we had a lot of backseat drivers in two cars. The owner speaks English a little and is extremely friendly and helpful. If you go during the winter time he could also be your ski instructor. We were just amazed at the view, the bed was comfy and the comforter, well lets just say I am searching for a down comforter like that now. The breakfast spread was delicious, made even better by the view we had. We opted to sit outside and just take in the view. It was the first time our table was quiet the entire trip. Everyone was relaxed and enjoying the quiet, the company but mostly the view. In the distance you can hear cow bells ringing and it doesn't bother you because it fits in with the scenery.

“We liked it so much we are considering a return to ski”,"We have just returned from 6 day holiday in the Dolomites. We flew to Munich (which was cheapest) rented a car, stayed in Innsbruck the first night and then carried on the Val Gardener and to Colfosco. We stayed in the Garni Delta for 2 nights and wished we had stayed longer. The accommodation is just outside Colfosco near the Hotel Kolfuschgerhof. In summer it is a nice walk into town for lunch or dinner and to join the plethora of marked trails. There is ample parking. We were warmly welcomed and found the hotel to be well kept, spotless and well run. I understand that you can request apartments but we stayed on a B&B basis. The room itself was spacious. We had a nice sized flat screen TV that showed English channels as well as French, German, Italian, Russian etc TV. It was nice to have a channel other then the news available. The bed linens were of good quality and the bed was comfortable. The room was spotless had everything that you needed including a small seating area and a balcony overlooking the back of the property. We did not take dinner at the hotel but the breakfast was excellent. As previously commended everything was top quality. Cereal, fresh fruit, cheese, ham, bread, boiled eggs and great coffee - in a comfortable beautifully decorated dinning room. There is a bar area and terrace. After walking we would come here for a refreshing beer. The views from the terrace of Colfosco are stunning. The walking is great and the hotel staff will take the time to recommend routes and features. Internet access is available. Overall we were very impressed with Garni Delta and the town of Colfosco for its beauty and the great walking. Both turned out to be great finds for us and we want to go back soon to try the skiing. Garni Delta was just right for us. We don't need a plush hotel but want somewhere clean of good quality and that we can look forward to returning to at the end of a long day's walking and this was it. We could have asked for no more. We commend the owners and have no hesitation in recommending it to others. Unfortunately our following two nights were spent in another Garni which unfortunately was not a patch on Delta Garni.

The family owners and staff are pleasant and friendly. The room and bathroom were simple but furnished with all the necessities. The breakfast buffet was extensive, with delicious and high quality ingredients. We had dinner at the Garni one night and were tremendously impressed with the food: simple but very good quality and well presented. The location is a bit out of Colfosco which could be a challenge if the road conditions are poor or you are planning to spend time in Corvara. However, the owning family are very generous to help with transportation, do pick-ups nearby as needed or arrange with local taxi services.

“Perfect Introduction to the Dolomites”,"During a month long trip in Italy my wife and I decided to explore the Dolomites. We have hiked and visited the Chamonix area many times and wondered how the Dolomites would compare. We were not disappointed! We arrived at Garni Delta tired from a hot day in Verona and a steep drive over Passo di Gardena. The owner welcomed us and quickly directed us to a nourishing local restaurant that we could reach by foot. The room was newly redecorated and included a table and a refrigerator as well as a beautiful view of the mountains. The breakfast buffet included meats, cheese, yogurt, eggs, fresh fruit and a variety of breads ... an outstanding start to the day. The first day we did a 5 hour hike on a loop that started and ended at the hotel. The second day we woke to rain and snow (yes, even in July) but found a wonderful wine bar at the Hotel La Perla in nearby Corvara (highly recommend) and explored the beautiful village of La Valle when the weather improved in the afternoon. On our third day we hiked to Refugio Viel de Pan near the Marmolada. We left the area wishing we had more time to experience all it has to offer. The key to the our enjoyable visit was Garni Delta. There are hundreds of places to stay in the Dolomites and to us they all look very similar. Garni Delta was unique because of the location, the excellent management, the food, and the fact that they are willing to take the time to understand and meet your needs ... their hospitality is what you always hope for, but do not often find, when you travel ... a real gem!",couple,POS
“Good Value for Money!”,"This location of this hotel is spectactular. Every way you look you are faced with incredible views of the locale from the lush valleys of Alta Badia on one side to the magnificent almost vertical peaks of the surrounding mountains. As other reviewers have remarked this is a very efficiently run family hotel, comfortably furnished and spotlessly clean. Stephan, Manuela and the rest of the team do their best to make you feel very welcome. The room we booked into was a little on the small side for the three of us including a 9 year old child, but was comfortable and we slept well. Breakfast was ok, but I think a few hot items items (such as eggs) would have been an improvement. The hotel does not include additional meals in the price but can provide sandwiches and snacks in the evening for a modest price if you do don't have the energy to go into Colfosco or neighbouring villages. It also has a resonable bar. Ones own transport is essential as the hotel is outside the village of Colfosco. a brisk half hours walk from the center. Also bear in mind, that although the distance from the autostrada (A22) does not seem that great, the roads leading to this area are very narrow and are punctuated by many hairpin bends (both up and down hill ), so allow yourself plenty of time to reach this destination. All in all a comfortable place to rest up after a hard days travelling!",family,POS

This landscape is simply amazing, and there are few better places to experience it than the very well-run and, for the price, quite luxurious Garni Delta. We loved our stay and still dream about going there for one whole week in winter. Apparently, we had booked a superior room: it had lots of space, a big very comfortable double bed, sofa and table, and a great balcony facing a spectacular mountain range on the other side of the valley. The friendly family that owns and runs the hotel do their best to make you feel welcome. Two minuses: it's short of nearby, decent restaurants (at least on a summer Sunday evening...) and it's not in the actual village, so you will definitely need your own transport.",couple,POS
“Absolutely loved this place”,"Do yourself a big favour, see the Alta Badia and stay at the Garni Delta. We stayed here 5 days in late September 2008. Where to start with the praise- a family run hotel with wonderfully friendly and helpful hosts in a fantastic location within the spectacular Alta Badia a high valley of the Dolomites. The hotel is a few hundreds metres walk from the beautiful village of Colfosco (walking towards Passo Gardena). Colfosco has a good a little supermarket including a deli. Many of the hotel rooms have stunning mountain views. From the balcony, the towering cliffs and ravines of the Sella massif are right in your face as well as a view down the valley. The hotel is very very good value - clean, comfortable, fantastic breakfast, spacious rooms with a very clean bathroom. A lovely cosy place to return to each evening. We are hikers and it was our first time in the Dolomites. The area compares well with Nepal and NZ. Right from the hotel doorstep there is a fantastic range of trail options from relatively easy to challenging ones. Although we had a map, our hosts provided us with a more user friendly one and were happy to explain the trail and weather conditions and provided good suggestions - its sensational walking. From Colfosco you can easily access three massifs by foot. All are criss crossed by trails so with more time there are heaps to choose from. We arrived in late September which is the end of the summer hiking season. Consequently, most of the scores of lifts used by the hikers in summer, and skiers in winter, were temporarily stopped for maintenance before the approaching ski season. If you come here a bit earlier, these lifts will extend your hiking range even further. We struck one day (& night) of falling snow. The thin layer slightly restricted easy walking. Most hotels here close from October to December and walking in that season would be too dodgy for most hikers. Reaching here without a car is not a problem. The train and bus service to and from the Alta Badia is easy, frequent and reliable. Despite being in Italy, this area is predominantly a German culture so everything is in prime condition and runs on time. To get there - take the train north from Verona to Brunico (We broke the journey at Trento). There is a train change at Fortezza station then hourly connections to Brunico. From there take the SAD bus (SAD has timetables on their website) past Corvara to Colfosco. By the way, despite the Tripadvisor stated location of Corvara - it is definately located at Colfosco. If you get off the bus at Corvara you will have a 4k walk uphill!",couple,POS
"“Great hotel, excellent value”",We stayed for 4 nights in September and agree with the other comments. This is a comfortable hotel in a peaceful setting with a beautiful view.

“Delightful hosts and views!”,"Garni Delta is located just above Colfosco. The views from their patio, where we had our breakfasts and an afternoon drink overlooked the valley below. Absolutely stunning! Our room was located in the back and from there we could see the Sella Massif and Pisciadu waterfall. The rooms were well equipped and nicely decorated in more of a Scandinavian style with lots of built in storage. The entire hotel felt very modern. A wonderful and varied breakfast was offered every morning. They also have a small menu to order dinner if you choose not to venture into town. The hosts were very friendly and accommodating. We would definitely stay here again! And just a mention about finding it, as the address is not going to come up in google maps or on your GPS. It's located just west of Colfosco at the turnout at the switchback. Keep driving towards the rear of the parking area and you'll see the sign for the small driveway to Garni Delta.

Richard and his son Stefan also run an excellent shuttle service down to and up from the lifts, nothing is too much trouble! Their staff are friendly and helpful. The evening meals, cooked by Stefan are simple but excellent, all home cooked. It is nice not to have to go out after a long day! We would definitely go again!",friends,POS
“A wonderful experience!”,"The hotel (together with two other hotels) is situated on the way from Colfosco to the mountain pass “Passo Gardena”. Since it's on the hill above the village Colfosco, it's possible to walk down from the hotel to the center of the village in 10 minutes. The hotel is a three-story building in Alpine-style. It's a family run hotel, managed by Tyrolean family from father, mother and adult son. Rooms are large with large balconies. They are warm and with plenty of space for clothes, etc. The hotel is very clean, the staff is helpful and kind. Breakfast is good, many cakes with a variety of local jam, strawberry, raspberry, etc. The disadvantages are the following: 1) There are no lifts near the hotel, to come back from the lifts (from the center of Colfosco) in the evening you should take the local bus which come every approximately 30 minutes. 2)The hotel hasn't own restaurant, so for dining one has to leave the hotel and walk to another hotel (2 minutes). But if you ski all day, came back home, hung out your clothes to dry and thoroughly washed and warmed in the shower, you absolutely do not want to get dressed again and go out in the evening cold. The advantage is a quiet location, beauty and nature around and comfortable rooms. Another important advantage is a good relation price/quality. I'd like to notice that the area Colfosco is great and, perhaps, one of the most picturesque in Dolomity.It's enough to remark that many mountain and rock scenes from the well-known Sylvester Stallone's movie “Cliffhanger” were made just in the mountains around Colfosco (but not in U.S.A., as one believes). Colfosco is situiated directly on Sella Ronda and connected with all other places for skiing in Dolomity, the most closest are Corvara and Val Gardena. The skiing directly in the Colfosco have such a feature. When you ride in the evening before closing the lifts, the hour comes when the sun is no longer in the valley, it set behind the mountains. But a huge rock that stands in the middle above the skiing is illuminated by the sun. And the sun is reflected from the mountain creating a special colour (pink) of snow, in which you roll. And you are flying on a pink snow in the valley under the bluish rock fairytale castles and you have an incredible feeling! So the experience of the place and the hotel --- wonderful!",None,POS
“Superb.”,"A classy B&B and great value. Very friendly owners who couldn't have been more helpful. The location is stunning, looking over Colfosco and Corvara, towards the mountains behind. You are hemmed in by glorious mountain scenery left and right too. Enjoy the fantastic breakfast on the terrace if you can. This area is well placed for exploring the rest of the Dolomites too.",family,POS

Alta Badia, Covara was just one stop, but when the opportunity arises again I will just ski this region, We skied hard for one week and only skied several slopes twice, the region is unbelievable. Overall I would have to say that the whole experience of staying at Sporthotel Panorama was the highlight of an unforgettable holiday I would like to thank the staff for a fantastic stay and especially Micheal Costamoling who seemed to be at the reception when we checked in and during dinner found the time to impart some of his wealth of knowledge of wine and by his guidance my partner and I traveled the wine regions of Italy over the coarse of a week without leaving restaurant.",couple,POS

We went there in April so we though we wouldn't have any problems in finding a free room and that was right. Being low season, many hotels seemed to be closed and ready to re-open by the end of the month. The Goldener Adler Hotel (meaning the """"Golden Eagle"""") was steps from the city centre and looked gorgeous seen from outside. We asked if they had free rooms and we were given a junior suite for the daily rate of 66 € per person breakfast included. We were with our car and we needed to pay extra 6,5 € daily for the parking. The room was spacious and nice, not really a junior suite but we liked it very much though, because it was very cosy, well equipped and beds were extra comfortable. The room had also a delicious balcony overlooking the river. The hotel is a 4* and surely deserves it, but no more, because it doesn't have all amenities you may ask for a 5*. The hotel offers also jacuzzi and sauna, but not a swimming pool. The common areas and lobby are simply beautiful and cosy.

“Most Enjoyable Stay in Ortisei/St. Ulrich - One of the best deals anywhere”,"Stayed at the Arnaria for three nights, to hiking in the Dolomites before my friend's weddding in Florence. Was honestly very surprised by the Arnaria. The rooms had a very clean design with lots of wood everywhere and a stunning view of the surrounding hills and mountains. My room was a family room (even though it was just me) and had a bunkbed next to the entrance and they seem quite cozy for the kids. The food was great, included breakfast and a 5 course dinner, gourmet style with a salad bar (the freshest veggies I've had in a long time), appetizers, first course and 2nd course and dessert (never had any because I was always too full by then). Facilities, was decent, a very small pool & gym, both which I didn't use, since I hiked like 20km+ every day, however they did have a very nice wet & dry sauna and a steam room. By the way the sauna rooms are co-ed ... I guess quit normal for Europe ... I didn't mind but my female friend was slightly uncomfortable at first, but I think she just got use to it. Finally the service, it was excellent also, Elizabeth and Martin were extremely helpfully and hospitalble, really took the extra mile to ensure we had the proper information all the time, felt more like we were staying at a friend's place than in a hotel. Which comes to the best part of the Arnaria, the VALUE, all the above and it came to less than EUR100 ... I paid 3 times as much for my room in Florence, wasn't half as good and didn't include a 5 course dinner. It's got to be the best value in all of Western Europe! The one complaint that I may have, and I say 'may' is that it's a bit of distance from town, however since I was there hiking, the extra kilometer or so to town was really nothing, however if I was skiing there, that might be a totally different proposition.

“Excellent Hotel”,"We stayed in this hotel for one week in June and really enjoyed our stay. The hosts are very friendly and helpful. The room was really nice.Lots of wood. Spacious with a separate sitting area and a balcony. Very nice bathroom with large walk-in shower. The breakfast was also very good and offered everything you can possible want. What really surprised us was dinner at night. We didn't expect the excellent five course dinners every night. A very different menu each day, always choice between different meals, and everything tasted excellent each day. The indoor swimming pool is a bit small. Parking in front of the hotel is free and from the hotel you have a nice view on the surrounding mountains. The only negative comment we can make is that the bed is quit hard and that is not very pleasant when you have lower back problems. Despite the bed however we will definitely go back to this hotel when we visit the Dolomites again.",couple,POS
“A great place to stay”,"We just returned from Italy, and our stay in Castelrotto was definitely a highlight! Hotel Zum Wolf al Lupo, where we stayed for 4 nights, was a wonderful hotel. The location on the old town square is perfect...close to great restaurants, a chair list to amazing hikes, and the buses that we used everyday to get around. The perks at Hotel Wolf were many, such as complimentary bus passes, excellent breakfasts, and private balconies over-looking the magnificent mountains. The owner Arno and his lovely wife were extremely accommodating, and eagerly shared their excellent knowledge of local hikes, restaurants, and anything else we needed. Castelrotto is a little slice of heaven, and we are eagerly planning our return trip there for next summer! Room Tip: We had a perfect corner room on the top floor. See more room tips",couple,POS
“Fantastic Service”,"I can't say enough good things about our stay in Castelrotto. Hotel Wolf is a lovely hotel in every respect. Clean, comfortable, quiet and relaxing with an absolutely delicious breakfast (eggs, cheese, meats, cereal, muesli, yogurt, juice, tea, coffee, cappuccino, bread and jams) included in the cost of the room. The Silbernagl's were great hosts. She was remarkably helpful in happily assisting us rearrange our travel to Frankfurt when our plans changed while we were staying there - it was as if she was also a travel agent. The cost of the room also includes free bus travel on the local bus lines which you'll use to get to the tram for hiking in the meadow or return to Bolzano for your train to your next location. Hiking in the Alpe di Suisi was beautiful. There are hikes of varying difficulty so virtually anyone can go up the tram and enjoy the meadow and mountains. The food is much more Austrian than Italian but still wonderful. Castelrotto is a very quaint and clean town. German seems to be the primary language but Italian is spoken as well. Fewer locals speak English than in major cities but we had no difficulty getting help when we needed it. If we return to Castelrotto we will definitely stay at Hotel Wolf again.",family,POS
“Returning Customers”,"My husband and I have stayed at this hotel nine years in a row.

Owners/staff are unfailingly helpful with advice about transportation, hikes, local events, restaurants, and the weather. English, German, and Italian languages. Laundry facilities for a small fee and free parking, too. And all at a bargain price considering the superb location and friendly service. We can't wait to get back there!

We ate in the breakfast room two days and it was very good. Plenty of food items with lots of variety. Parking was secure on property, just out the back door. There was an elevator which was nice as not all hotels in Italy have one. I would love to return to Castelrotto and stay here!",couple,POS

Our room was spacious, with a balcony, a dining nook, a seating area, and a nice, clean, large bathroom. The breakfast was really nice! The cost on checkout was lower than quoted in my reservation, which was an excellent price as it was!

“Just brilliant”,"Just back from our latest Ski trip 9th-16th Feb (23 years of ski adventures) after a long transfer we came in via Venice to save on flight costs, our group of 12 were a little cold - it was minus 20 degrees over the mountain passes and also getting a bit peckish, we received a very warm welcome and after putting our bags into our rooms (good first impressions) came down to a fantastic 5 course meal, this standard continued every day and the breakfasts were just as good with a great selection to choose from (late to ski slopes most mornings) Our rooms were comfortable of good size and very clean, as the week went on we found we just relaxed into a perfect combination of good food and drink (drink prices were very reasonable) like being looked after by your own family, we have a couple of vegetarians in our group and they were well catered for as well, I think I ate every course. You know, sometimes it's hard to put your finger on just what made this hotel so good, probably the owners and their staff but we all loved it.

“Mountain treks every day and wonderful dinners every night!”,"We chose Hotel Digon after reading the great reviews on Tripadvisor and we didn't have one disappointing moment. Daniel made us very welcome and was most helpful in planning our daily walks. We purchased a combined bus/lift pass (80 Euros) which was perfect. We completed walks which we would never have thought possible looking at the map but the recommendations by Daniel were all achievable for a couple in their 60's. It was particularly exciting on the day it snowed (can always happen at any time of year) and added even more interest to the photos. It was always nice to be dropped off by bus to return to the hotel each day and the lifts took us up to almost 3000m. The rooms were very comfortable and breakfast and dinner were always an exceptional treat. We stayed for a week and the value for half-board is the best we have experienced in many years of travel.

“Great hotel!”,"We traveled with another couple and had two rooms in the new building. The rooms were large with beautiful wood and such comfortable bedding and bathrooms! The views of the valley from the balcony were beautiful! Our only complaint was the extra charge for WiFi since most hotels on our trip didn't charge for this. Breakfast had a good variety and dinners were good and a great value - it was so nice not to have to leave the hotel for dinner. The service was very good and we would definitely recommend this hotel and the town. Our day hike in the mountains and walks around the town were like being in a fairy tale setting - just picture perfect!

The room, beds, and bathroom met all of our needs. Highly recommended!",family,POS
“A great hotel with very nice owners. We had a wonderful stay”,We spent 9 days at hotel Digon in March 2012. It is a very good hotel. We stayed in the new building on the second floor with a nice view. Everything was so clean and nice. The only thing maybe missing was some decoration ( pictures on the walls). I just love bathrooms where everything is so new and shining. Our bathroom was like that at Digon. The owners are so nice and helpful and also the staff. We liked our waiter Matheo with his great humor. I wish that we could speak better German. Then we would have been able to chat more with Mr. and Mrs. Stuflesser. But their son speaks english fluently so we got the chance to speak with him and he helped us in everyway he could with all kind of informations. I won't skip mentioning the food wich was absolutely great. For 9 days I could not help gaining some waight. But that's ok :-). I'm sure we will be staying at this hotel again and I have been telling friends and family about it. I know some of them are staying at Digon in the coming years.,None,POS
“Excellent!”,"Been meaning to add a review for over a year now... I concur completely with all of the positive comments others have made here - the family (Daniel!), the staff (Mateo!), the hotel (lots of beautiful wood - on the ceilings even!), the food (I'd never had 5-course meals before... Wow!), quick and easy and regular bus rides into town and the lifts. We had a group of 'about 20 from California, back in March of 2011, for a ski trip there. Weather and snow was so-so, but it was fun skiing and ending up in another town at the end of the day, having a few beers and catching one of the local buses back to Ortisei. Yeah! And the day-trip doing the Sellaronda (I've never been on so many different ski runs, ski areas, and different lift types, in one day, in my entire life! :) made the trip very, very memorable - thank you, thank you Daniel (damn nice guy, and hell of a skier!)! We'll be back! And some of us did an easy, scenic, fun day-trip on the local bus into Bolzano one day - to see the sights and the Ice Man! cheers, jt (jwt1969@gmail.com) Room Tip: All seemed fine.

“Best place in all of the Dolomities”,"After hours of searching the perfect hotel in the area we came across hotel Digon, it has a high review rate so we thought it is a good bet. Perfect - everything was perfect, the food was AMAZING (must take the half board!!!!MUST) the room were so clean, it felt like we are the first customers of this hotel. The warmth from the staff makes you feel like you are their only customer, they are always there to help and attentive to every detail. Location - some people say that the location isn't best, well, they are mistaken, it is true it is not in the middle of the city, by would rather wake up and eat breakfast with a breathtaking view and then take a 5 min bus than anything else (the bus stop is right outside the hotel) We picked this ski area because it is one of the best in Italy and thought that it will be the major attraction of this holiday but we were mistaken hotel Digon was just as good as the ski area. Thank you for an great experience, we hope we will come back soon. Omer and Shira",couple,POS
“All Hotels should be run like this”,"This was quite simply the best run hotel we have ever stayed in. The family is warm, welcoming and professional. Every single detail is taken care of, as if by magic. My husband celebrated his birthday while we stayed and they decorated the table with red ribbon and presented a tasty, yet light homemade cake accompanied with pink sparkly wine. The accomodation is comfortable, warm and very well finished to a high standard. The food is outstanding and reflects local culture from the region. We were treated to local specialities every night. The rest of the staff were excellent too with a special mention to Mateo (our waiter). The hotel is slightly outside the main centre of town but only slightly. There is a very regular bus which takes you to the centre in a few minutes; the stop is just outside the hotel. The only downside...we had to return home!",family,POS
“wonderful hospitaliy...”,"This is a long over due review, we stayed at hotel Digon in September. Our stay here was the best out of our whole trip to Europe that was 2 months long. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by Grandma Stuflesser and instantly felt like home.. The family is wonderfully and there hospitality is amazing. They will go out of there way to make sure that your stay is comfortable and that you enjoy your time in Ortisei. Daniel took the time to go over information about the area as well as where to eat for lunch and answer any questions.. Our room was clean, comfortable and the view was stunning. The food was always very fresh and plentiful.. Matteo our server was great and seems to love working for this family.. This will definitely be the place I would recommend people to stay and hope to return one day.. Aloha Hotel Digon",couple,POS
“Superb Stay!”,"Based on other reviews, we had high expectations of our stay at Hotel Digon in late September. Amazingly, the stay far exceeded our expectations! My wife and I have stayed at many B&Bs and inns over 40 years of traveling, and I must say that the Stuflesser family (the owners) and their staff are the friendliest hosts we have ever encountered. This was not the feigned friendliness one sometimes encounters at hotels; they were truly warm, down-to-earth people. They were amazingly gracious in providing information on the area and in responding to any request we had. Matteo, who served us during breakfast and dinner at the hotel, brightened the entire dining room with his cheerfulness and humor. Both meals are included in the room rate, and the food was very plentiful and very tasty. Our room was reasonably-sized, attractively appointed and furnished and had a grand and lovely view of the valley and mountains. The hotel was very conveniently located but out of the hubbub of the town. Buses regularly stopped at the hotel, and the drive to town took only about two minutes. If we ever return to the Dolomites (and it is a land of stunning beauty), we can't imagine staying anywhere other than the Hotel Digon.

“Best Hotel Ever”,"We have stayed many times in Val Gardena but never at the Digon , but we will never stay anywhere else again, the food amazing, the rooms beautiful and the service 6 star at least ,it is family run and you arrive as strangers and leave as friends... we cannot wait to return",couple,POS
"“The food is great, the view is great. The folk are great. I want to go back.”","It was such a pleasure to stay here. The staff was so friendly and helpful and amazingly spoke English, German, Ladin and Italian. Dinners were as delicious as the stunning June panoramas we saw in the Seiser Alm. Sitting on the patio of our room or on the larger one off the common room was such a nice way to relax after a day of hiking. Hotel Digon is perhaps a 40 minute walk from town, but we enjoyed the walk through the bush, just to see the local orchids. Buses are available, so if we hadn't a car, it would have been easy to get around. The hotel had many partnerships with local resources( gym, pool, organized hikes) that we certainly would have used if our stay had been longer than the four days. This will definitely be our spot for the next trip to the Val Gardena",couple,POS
“Superb Family Hotel”,Among our great travels in this totally Tirolian village of Italy was the great hospitality we received from Hotel Wolf. We were greeted very late at night by a smiley young lately who went out of her way to stay up for us and arrange parking. The coziness of the room and cleanliness of the place made it so enjoyable.

They were always willing to give advice and answer questions. We loved the Tirolean atmosphere and wonderful balcony with a gorgeous view of the Dolomites with the late afternoon sun on them. The bathroom had a long counter, which I like for my cosmetics. They have parking in the back, where the buses also stop. They have an elevator, a bar area and wonderful breakfasts.

"“While visiting Castelrotto, consider staying at Hotel Zum Wolf al Lupo!”","The Silbernagl Family at Hotel Zum Wolf al Lupo are excellent hosts. Their hotel is a clean, attractive, and well run operation. Our room was crisp and spotless. The view of the surrounding area was dramatic. We consider it an excellent value. The operators did not hesitate to offer help when we asked for information about the area. For travelers such as ourselves, hiking in the Dolomites is THE reason for coming to Castelrotto. They explained which bus to take to the hiking starting points and how to purchase the tickets for hiking in the suggested areas. This was very useful and time saving information and our planned hikes in the Dolomites were successful because of their willingness to help us. The breakfast was outstanding. Plenty of fresh and tasty breads, meats, cheeses, juice...all the goodies you want in a European style breakfast. Yum... Guests can take advantage of their bar in the evening. They offer drinks at reasonable prices. Here you can swap stories with other guests about the hiking adventures of the day. We liked this place a lot. Thanks Silbernagl Family!

“Disappointing”,"We chose this hotel because of the good reviews on Tripadvisor. But for us was quite disappointing. The hotel is clean,the room we were, in the green house, spacious and with a nice terrace(at a price anyway!). And housekeeping was outstanding. The same can be said about the swimming pools when no children do what they want desides the rules. But those who are thinking in choosing this hotel for their stay should know in my opinion that a) Reception is nonexistent (except for paying the bill). No information about where is the room, the garage or breakfast or dinner hours. Nothing if not asked. And the way can be not an easy one. b) Common areas are too small for the size of the hotel which has severals buildings. Neither the dining room or the pool area, payment required without wellness card, or the garage are the size needed for the the hotel. And for us the last thing one expects to find in holidays is trouble finding a parking space (45€ the week) or to find a free table (which for some guests can be book for breakfast and for some not). We stayed for a week an each evening we have to change the table besides the policy they have to seat always in the same. Food was acceptable but scarce in some items if you like to have dinner after 20.15 (i.e.near 9PM when service ends). c) We had in the room of the above floor a family with young children. It was a torment because their runs were perfectly audible. And annoying!! Specially early morning and at night. So I doubt we will be back besides so many good reviews. Perhaps there is no best options in Bressannone/Brixen but there are better places in Alto Adige.",couple,NEG

In the evenings, they open a No Host “On your Honor” bar with wine, beer and other beverages. Take what you want, just write down what you have drank, and they add it to your room bill. Their beverage prices are quite reasonable. They have washer available for their guest’s use, which we found really convenient as we were in the middle of a 5 week European Adventure. They do not have a clothes dryer available, but in June everything dries in about 4 hours so this was not a problem. The breakfast was one of the best we had had in Europe.

“A jewel in the heart of the Dolomites”,This is my fifth visit to Hotel Digon and it never fails to impress me.

Frau Schuflesser is a wonderful cook and is always happy to cook non-meat dishes for me. The breakfast is as good as any five star hotel can provide.

"“Lovely and attentive service, fantastic value, great hearty food”","Probably my favorite hotel in all of Italy during my 3 week trip to Rome, Venice, Florence, Ortisei and Cinque Terre. This is family run hotel establishment shows great care and pride in their hotel. Being a solo traveler who had never been to the Dolomites, I was anxious about how I would get around and what it might be like. This hotel made it easy. They offered to pick me up at the bus station and ended up dropping me off the day of my departure. The hotel is actually only a few miles from the town center and there is great bus service but their hospitality was most appreciated and made things easier given my arrival/departure times. The meals were extensive and fulfilling - many courses for dinner and a big breakfast buffet and the food, much of it from their family farm was hearty Tyrolean cuisine, and no lack of healthy ingredient! It was such a great value, too - around 60 euros a night including a 5 course dinner. I loved having dinner there each night - I ordered a bottle of wine the first night and each night they brought it out and I could continue to enjoy it. The Dolomites are so superb and Hotel Digon exemplifies part of the perfect Dolomites experience - which in my opinion combines the best of German and Italian culture (Italian kitchen and German quality is a saying that someone there taught me and sums it up!) The views and hikes are spectacular and so breath-taking. And the people there care so much about their beautiful surroundings. If you go, also make sure to do some hiking and have lunch in the mountains at a riffugio!",None,POS
“Gorgeous and Gracious”,"Hotel Digon was one of our favorite hotels on our one mony honeymoon in Europe. The Dolomite is a beautiful area, and we wished we had more time here. The hotel is not inside the main city center. It is about 3 miles away, but easily reachable by the local bus, and it is better that it is not in the main city center, because of the spectacular views you get from your own balcony. Wow! Not only is this hotel perfectly situated, the family that own this hotel are the most gracious hosts. They are extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast and dinners were delicious, and the room we had was very comfortable. The hiking here was enjoyable, with some of the best alpine views and photo spots. There are trails for all levels of hiking. Interestingly, we found our favorite gelato shop in Ortissei/St. Ulrich, even better than the supposed great gelato of Florence. Even though this town was in Italy, there were many people speaking German here. We would love to come back and we highly recommend this place as a relaxing vacation spot with great food, good people, and stunningly unique landscape.",couple,POS

"“Warm, friendly, perfectly comfortable, and a great value”","We stayed at the Hotel Digon in the spectacular Val Gardena for 5 nights in September and it was one of the best holiday experiences of our lives. Here's why: Service: The beauty of the region was enhanced by the excellent service provided by the Hotel Digon, and specifically by Daniel, son of the owners, who appeared to be able to speak any and all languages. We were the only English speakers there for most of our time, so we appreciated him very much. Klaus was our excellent waiter, and he could not have been more competent and warm. We were picked up in the town centre on arrival, lent walking sticks, and treated very well. The staff were always cheerful and prepared to answer any questions. Flawless. Location: The hotel's location, away from the town centre, was, for us, perfect-- no other buildings overlook the hotel, so we had complete privacy in the room and on the balcony and could leave the window and curtains open at night. This arrangement would be difficult to find in the centre of Ortisei since the houses and hotels are very close together. The walk to town was an easy 15 minutes, mostly downhill. We took the bus back home-- the bus to/from Castelrotto and the centre of Ortisei stops directly in front of the hotel. Services: There is no pool at the hotel (or spa, or sauna…) but access to the lovely Ortisei public pool was free (swim caps mandatory, so bring one or buy one there). Guided hikes were also free, but a bit of a challenge for English speakers as they were conducted in German and Italian. We got by with our smattering of Italian and French, and the guide was very accommodating. Room: We loved our room in the new building: bright, spotlessly clean, with a great shower (no bath), double sink and bidet, comfortable bed, fluffy duvets and lots of storage. We liked that the floor was bare pine rather than carpeted. There was a very nice view from the balcony over green lawns and down to the valley. Food: The half-board plan is a fantastic deal. The quantity of food is very generous, and the quality, while not at the fine dining level, was very good. Breakfast is a buffet of cereals and yogurt, fruit salad, pastries, boiled or scrambled eggs, bacon, cold meats, cheeses and breads. The dinner menu was presented each morning, giving an opportunity to request substitutions, which were never a problem. The menu featured quite a bit of beef and veal when we were there. We recommend that you let them know clearly in advance what you can and cannot eat: one of us did not eat beef, but they confused this for vegetarianism. As it turns out, the vegetarian options were delicious, if cheesy. The wine list was good, but pricey-- least expensive bottle was 14E--but they will hold a partially consumed bottle for you for the next night, if you wish. Suggestions and downsides: It is hard to find fault with such a wonderful place, but there are a few very minor issues that could be addressed to make the Digon even better. Tables in the dining room were assigned by room and did not change over the course of our stay-- which is fine if you have a nice table looking out to the valley, but not so great if your table looks out to the car park. We would have appreciated a rotation of tables so we had a change of view and new neighbours to chat with. The exterior lighting was on a timer that went out too late for us, so we couldn't see the stars. I would put the lights in the control of the rooms, or turn them out earlier. A less expensive house wine by the litre of half-litre would have been appreciated. Last point: We arrived at the hotel as a female couple in what appears to be a fairly conservative area. In our experience, some hotels will switch us from a booked room with a double bed to two singles when they see us, or treat us differently from straight couples. This can really affect the tone of our holidays and make us uncomfortable. I am happy to report that the Digon staff never missed a beat—there was absolutely no weirdness or tone, and no attempt to shift us to a room with twin beds. In fact, we were upgraded—for no apparent reason — to a higher level room on arrival. We really appreciated this excellent service and will most certainly return to this hotel on our next visit to the area.",couple,POS
"“Like Living """"The Sound of Music!""""”","Having been to Venice 4 years ago, with trips in the intervening years to Florence and Rome and environs, we wanted to return to Venice, and also see places nearby: Ravenna, Padua, and the Dolomites. Using TripAdvisor, I settled on Castelrotto or Kastelruth for the Dolomites and selected the Hotel Zum Wolf based on the few reviews, all positive, that were posted for this hotel. My wife & I were wondering if it were too ambitious to drive in the mountains, but we are so glad that we did! We learned that we were there towards the end of the """"walking season."""" It had rained the night before, but we had two glorious days very close to heaven. Our room was as advertised, with a nice balcony overlooking the valley and very pleasantly furnished in Tyrolean pine. The bath was great, with a tub and shower combination and plenty of room. The breakfasts were fun: we boiled our own eggs and enjoyed cheeses, ham, yogurt and nice breads. The town is truly picturebook! The ski lifts to the Alpe Suisse (an 8 mile wide pasture where cows summer) were operating and there were lots of interesting trails to explore. The vistas were as if one were truly """"flying like an eagle."""" The co-owner / wife of the innkeeper was very pleasant and offered us good suggestions for hikes and restaurants. I heartily recommend exploring this part of Italy and, if you are in the area, I would recommend that you stay at this lovely inn.

"“Great location, not fancy, but spacious with great views from some rooms”","Excellent location in center of town and right in front of the main bus terminal in Castelrotto. Once you arrive in Castelrotto there is no need to drive as there is complimentary bus service. Quaint hotel with beautiful views from the rear facing rooms. Rooms are not fancy but adequate. It is worth upgrading to the suite rooms as the extra space is very nice. Wireless internet is avaliable only in the lobby for a fee. Breakfast is adequate, but nothing special. Front desk personnel are knowledgeable and pleasant, but not overly warm. Avoid all three of their listed restaurant recommendations (particularily the Liftstuberl) as these were the only bad meals we had in two weeks in Italy.",couple,POS
“Wonderful location--especially when construction is done”,"Unfortunately the town is undergoing major construction so some of the roads are closed, making it a challange to get in and out.

We felt like we were staying with old friends! Great view from the balcony and perfect location for enjoying the town. The full sized tub was wonderful after a long day of hiking and the opportunity to do laundry (for a small fee) was really appreciated. Our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer!,couple,POS
“Great base for Dolomite walks”,"We used this hotel as a base to do some of the local walks and also to visit the Otzi museum in Balzano which is worth visiting .

We also appreciated the excellent laundry facilities for a nominal charge. The owners really helped us plan our hiking to meet our level and were helpful also with restaurants and other activities.

“Great View in a Convenient Location”,"My fiance and I stayed here for one night in July 2013. We splurged (for us) and stayed in a room with a balcony. It was definitely worth the extra euros because the scenery surrounding the area was spectacular. We were both impressed with the selection for breakfast - eggs, cereal, yogurt. The staff was courteous and we always had a parking space. Great base to explore the region and hiking trails. I would definitely stay at Hotel Zum Wolf again and really hope to return to this unique part of Italy.",couple,POS

“We Loved Hotel Cavallino d' Oro-Very Charming”,"We stayed in Suite #6 and it had a spacious bedroom and bathroom along with a very nice patio with several lounge chairs, table and chairs and a great view of the mountains. The suite was a great value for the money. This was the best room we had during our stay in Italy. Our room and the hotel is decorated with great charm. The front desk staff throughout our stay were always very helpful and spoke excellent English. They have a very large bar area near the lobby that provides a place to have drinks and mingle with the other guests. The WiFi didn't work for us in our room, but they have a computer in the lobby that worked fine. The restaurant has excellent food and we had 2 dinners there. Only negative is that the waiter Marco wasn't very helpful with the translation of the menu items on the 1st night (it was in German) but the 2nd night we asked for a menu in Italian which worked better for us. Breakfast buffet choices & food was great. We used the complimentary laundry which we appreciated for the convenience. We enjoyed the hiking in the Alpi di Siusi. This is a wonderful spot to take a break from the cities. If you arrive by car, they do provide complimentary parking in a private secured parking structure.

“Not just excellent -- perfect”,"I should just copy and paste all of the other positive reviews people have written about this hotel. This was our third trip to Castelrotto and our second time to stay at Cavallino d'Oro. This hotel is beautiful, clean, and professionally managed. The rooms and public areas are tastefully furnished and decorated with an eye for artistic detail. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are beautifully modern with a big, inviting tub. The price of the hotel makes it an excellent value. In fact, it was our least expensive hotel for this two-week trip to Italy. We spent our days hiking, but we enjoyed spending our late afternoons and evenings in our room and in the hotel public areas. The bar is like a beautifully decorated parlor in a private home. You can pass the time there with your traveling partner or you can interact with other guests. The hotel breakfast is great and wonderfully presented in their elegant dining room. We had our lunches while we were out hiking. (Hiking in Europe is so civilized. You're never more than a half hour away from food and drink.) But, we took all of our evening meals at the hotel. On our past stays, we've sampled the other restaurants in town -- which are pretty good -- but we found that we couldn't beat the hotel restaurant for quality, service, and value. The hotel has a free, guest laundry. The dryer takes a little time, so don't get into laundry if you plan to do a lot of other activities that day. The hotel provides free-parking in a reserved section of a new, public garage. It's located very nearby and has an elevator that brings you up to street level just a stone's throw from the hotel door. The parking is a whole lot closer than your average American chain hotel. If you're taking the bus, the station is right behind the hotel. The hotel facility is very nice, but the main attraction of Cavallino d'Oro is the people who run it. They are friendly, professional, and possess excellent language skills. The guests at this hotel primarily speak either German, Italian, or English. The staff seems to be fluent in all three. We really enjoyed meeting and interacting with the people who work here. It made the meals very pleasant. And we enjoyed spending a couple of minutes with the front desk staff as we came and went. Castelrotto is one of our favorite destinations. This hotel will always be our first choice. If necessary we would try to change our itinerary in order to get reservations here.",couple,POS
“Deserves all the praise given in previous reviews”,"This hotel is ideally situated, meticulously maintained, and operated in the highest standard of South Tyrolean efficiency and order. Its location -- just a few minutes from the bus station -- makes travel to the Seiser Alm quick and easy. For those venturing out on day visits to neighboring towns and places, the Mobil Card is a great value for all forms of travel throughout the South Tyrol. A special thanks to Rosi (hotel's front desk) is in order here for her help in sorting out bus schedules and connections. Finally, we can't finish this review without mentioning that the half-board option of breakfast and dinner was greatly appreciated. Food quality and choices were excellent. Our compliments to the owners of this family-run hotel for their dedication to high service.",couple,POS

Whole package of information for us was already prepared and provided when we get here. (today is my check out date and I am writing a review at a lobby..) Very nice and helpful service by kind staffs. Only 2 drawbacks were- 1) we booked a double room with an extra bed but that extra bed was somehow a little bit small for an adult. But it was ok quality though. 2) there was no refrigerator in a room However, all in all, I strongly recommend this place! It was a good stay for sure :)",family,POS
“Wonderful hotel!”,"My husband and I stayed for a couple nights, in a room that had a terrace with a gorgeous view of the mountains. The decoration of the room was lovely, the staff was very friendly, and the food ( both breakfast and dinner were included in the price of the room) was tasty and well- prepared. The location was also excellent, in the main square of the village. If you come by bus, the station is just the street below the hotel.",couple,POS
“a home away from home”,"We have recently completed our 13th yearly visit and stay at the Cavallino d'Oro. After spending three nights on our first visit in 2000, we now stay for at least two weeks in the summer. Perhaps that speaks for itself. We have tried other places in the South Tyrol, but this is a special place that provides an experience that is not found elsewhere. From the owners, Stefan and Susanne Urthaler, as well as their very capable and congenial staff, every guest receives great hospitality. At the reception desk, Rosi is always cheerful and helpful --- and an immensely talented and dependable resource at planning walks or other activities. Marco, the maitre d', is knowledgeable, efficient and reliable. Monika offers a cheerful presence in the dining room. Each of them, in his or her own way, as well as other members of the staff, makes the place great. While some guests choose to eat dinners outside of the hotel, it is entirely unnecessary --- in fact it is a huge mistake. The food is abundant, very well prepared, and always satisfying. The guest rooms vary a bit in size, design and furnishings, but they are all impeccably clean and comfortable. The bar, now under the congenial Mirka, provides the setting after dinner to make new friends. The town of Kastelruth itself is an uniquely charming place --- which leaves unforgettable memories. The summer hiking in the Alpe di Siusi, easily reached by bus and/or a cabin lift, restores physical health as well as emotional and spiritual well being. But while many visitors only come for a day or two, it is absolutely necessary to spend a week or two here in order to enjoy the fuller benefit of the many trails. While the Puflatsch/Bullaccia side is a nice introduction, the Panorama side deserves even more time. Go to a supermarket and have them make sandwiches for your backpack or have a great lunch in a hutte up on the Alpe. Bring your walking poles. Buy the CombiCard for the bus and the Cabinovia. It's all well worth it. But while the Alpe is stunning, staying at the Cavallino is the heart of the experience. While someone may find something to quibble about, the good things far outweigh anything else. And the gracious and warm atmosphere is priceless. There is so much that is just great about this place. As so many have noted, you become part of a family here. And the day that you leave becomes the saddest day of the year. It's nothing less than a home away from home. Maybe we'll even meet you here next year! Room Tip: We would take any room here! See more room tips",couple,POS
“Voted our #1 favorite in Italy”,"We traveled Italy for 3 weeks. We stayed in and out of hotels and we loved it here. When we walked in the door we were treated like family...thank you Stefan and Susanne! Our room was large..which was a nice change and SO clean! As their website says, WiFi free, parking free, pets free, laundry free. It was true. You were not nickle'd and dime'd to death. Now, they had only one washer and dryer with some time restraints but they even provided the soap. You had to be patient and courteous to other travelers also washing but we got all of our laundry done in one morning. We, as guests of the hotel, had our own reserved table for every meal...which we did end up eating there each evening. They had the same wait staff who were most pleasant! Be careful if you get the Beef Bourguignon...it is a TON of food. Absolutely worth it but eat nothing else :) The location was perfect with walking distance to the bus station...well, everywhere. We would definitely return to Castlerotto and we would DEFINITELY stay here! Thank you Stefan & Susanne for a memorable experience! Come and visit us in Colorado! John and Laurie",couple,POS
“Excellent location and very comfortable stay”,"My family of three went to this hotel with very high expectations after reading the wonderful reviews on tripadvisor and this hotel even exceeded our expectations. Both room and bathroom are large and clean. We looked forward to both breakfast and dinner on both days while we stayed there. All the staff speak excellent English and gave good advice on travelling around the region. It is located near to the bus station which is very useful for us as we get around on the buses.(Took a pleasant 50 mins journey to get here from Bolzano train station by bus 170) The day ticket(1.50 euro) by the local buses allows us to get to the cable car station within 15 mins and also allows us to travel from the cable car station to Ortisei in 30 mins. There are also other buses to towns like Brixen. Behind the hotel, is a path up the hill which allows us to get very good shot of the mountains and bell tower. The free use of the washing machine (free detergent) and dryer also adds value to this hotel. Also available is a computer for us to check on our emails etc. Highly recommend this hotel and Castelrotto is one of the prettiest town around this region. It is a good base for travelling in this region.",family,POS

“Fabulous and affordable”,"This is a beautiful, well appointed hotel directly on the town square in Castelrotto, Italy. The staff (front desk, restaurant, and lounge) was incredibly friendly and helpful. Our double room was large, nicely decorated and airy, with large windows and skylights that opened to allow additional circulation. The dining room was bright and comfortable. Breakfast was included in our room rate and it was first rate. The hotel has a ground-floor space for storing mountain bikes. The Cavallino served as our base for exploring the Alpe di Suisi and the combination of the hotel and this remarkable outdoor venue provided the highlight of our 15 day driving tour of the Alps. We felt more at home here than anywhere else we stayed along the way.",couple,POS
“The service was over the top. The hotel was old-world stylish in every way.”,"The service was over the top. The hotel was old-world stylish in every way. I don't often go out of my way to write a review, however I have to say that the golden horse (Cavallino d'Oro) was wonderful. We booked for 3 nights initially, then added 2. The area has so much to do and it is so well organized. We hiked two days, and rented biked in Compatsch one day. There's a deal too--ride the bike on trails/roads from Compatsch, then arrange to return the bikes at the bottom of the hill. I think we went 10 km in 15 minutes. There was no extra fee to return the bikes at a hotel near the bottom of the cable car in Siusi. But back to the hotel, the sauna was great, there was plenty of delicious food (we stayed for dinner every night) and the staff couldn't be more helpful. The internet worked as well as anywhere, so we were happy. There is a lot of comfortable common area, with nice views. Being right on the square was really charming. In short, it was like a resort where we got to know some of the other guests and probably have arranged a house trade for the future.",couple,POS
"“This is the town and hotel to stay at in Northern Italy, or do I mean Southern Austria?”","The town is beautiful. The hotel is beautiful. This is where you want to stay. My wife and I get our hotel recommendations from Rick Steve's travel books and then cross reference them here at Trip Advisor. RS and TA are correct with this one, it is a great hotel. The rooms are comfortable, clean and the fresh mountain air feels great as you sit in your room and watch this mountain town. The rooms are large, for European standards, typical of alpine hotels I have stayed at. It was nice to have a couch and a chair to sit on instead of the bed. The bathroom is large as well. Our room faced the square, just to the side of the bell tower (near the church), this was amazing, more on this later. The only gripe I have is the cleaning staff would get a prompt start every morning around 7 am and I'd prefer to sleep undisturbed until around 8:30 (vacation!) but I could hear them moving around in the hallway. The restaurant is nice, but too fancy for me. I'm more of a schnitzel and beer kind of guy. My wife and I ate there one night, and as I said, it just wasn't my style. But I'm sure that for people with a more sophisticated palette, it would be excellent. The free breakfast was excellent, for any palette! Kastelruth is great """"base camp"""" for exploring northern Italy and it is easy to get to the hotel from Bozen. Take the Bus from Bozen to Kastelruth and ride it to the end of the line (you can tell because the bus will pull into a little """"bahnhof"""" and the bus will be pointing towards a school (schule). Plus, the 50 min bus ride up the mountain is like a roller-coaster. My wife and I happened to be in Kastelruth during their Corpus Christi and St. Peter & Paul celebration. If it is possible for you to book your trip anytime, do it during this. It was a treat to watch and be a part of (plus, the festival in the evening was a blast). My only gripe, put Wifi in that reaches more than just the bar. I want to use it in my room! Susanne Urthaler was an angel and a delight for my wife and I to talk to each day. She runs an amazing hotel along with the rest of the wonderful staff. I love the Alps, and would suggest this hotel!",couple,POS
“Excellent.”,"We spent a long weekend here just recently with our three year-old daughter and had a great time. The staff is spectacular, the food divine, the room (romantik) was gorgeous, the facilities impressive but by far the coolest thing was the wine cellar tour. Only hotel guests can partake in the tour, but it is well worth it. Staying at La Perla is the total hotel experience: aside from what I've already mentioned, being 30 meters from the gondola entrance, ample and easy parking, abundant and pleasing wait staff, the most rewarding and custom breakfast offerings, easy downhill walk to shops and no hassle transactions all made it complete. I will stay here again.",family,POS
"“Charming, welcoming”","This hotel in the old center city of Castelrotto/Kastelruth reflects its dual heritage, since this sliver of Italy was firmly part of Austria for centuries before World War I and is still largely German-speaking and culturally Austrian/German. The hotel itself is lovely, if initially hard to get to by car. Once one finds it, the staff is wonderfully welcoming and eager to direct guests to the nearby garage once they are checked in. Our room was lovely, spacious, comfortable. It was at the front of the hotel, overlooking a bell tower which rings every hour on the hour, loudly. The hotel has excellent sound-proofing windows, but in warm weather when it would be necessary to keep windows open during the night it would have been awful, so at that time of year it might be best to ask for a room in the back of the hotel. We ate in the hotel one night. The food was excellent. The town itself is a great place to walk, and many picturesque places are within a short drive.

“Excellent!”,"I booked this hotel for new years eve only one week before - my original booking in Merano had been cancelled by the hotel at the last minute so after much searching the Cavallino had a cancellation and were able to fit us in. Unfortunately when we arrived at 7pm on the 29th December it transpired that i had not read the booking correctly and i had booked only 2 nights instead of the 3 nights as intended. So they had no room for us that night! After an initial internal panic on my part the problem was quickly solved by the very competent Stephan who made a short phone call and procured a room for us within 2 minutes walking distance, dinner was served for us in the Cavallino within the hour and our room was ready by 10.30 the next morning! What could have been a disaster was superbly handled by Stephan and we went on to have a fabulous New Year in Castelrotto. The food at the hotel was fantastic, the waiting staff very pleasant and the wine list excellent and at a reasonable price. The head waiter was very knowledgeable about the local wines. The New Years Eve celebrations were memorable. Champagne and canapes from 7.30pm followed by a 7 course meal and then champagne served in the bar from 11pm ready for midnight. The fireworks were the best i have ever seen and we enjoyed them from the balcony of our room. All in all an excellent stay with excellent staff. One small criticism is that the food in the restaurant did feel a little rushed - maybe 10-15mins between each course would be nice but this did not in any way spoil our time. Thank you again to Stephan for finding us a room at the Inn! Room Tip: If you want to avoid the sound of the bells choose a room at the back - personally i love traveling...

“Central location in lovely small town”,"We booked this hotel the night before arrival for two nights over a busy weekend. Due to the lateness of the booking we were allocated the last room available (room 23 I think it was), which is probably the worst double room in the hotel due to it being a rather small room and the headroom is compromised by the sloping roof, which I frequently banged my head on. In my opinion this room should only have been a single, or sold much cheaper than the others, most of which are much larger. So why have I given the hotel an overall Very Good rating? Well, we were originally only booked in for two nights, but before checking out on Monday morning I said I would book another two nights if they had a better room. As it was Monday, with a lot of people checking out, many rooms became available and we were shown several rooms of which we had a free choice. We chose a room to our liking and stayed a further two nights. Note though that the rooms are of differing shapes and sizes and all priced the same (unless it's a Junior Suite), so if busy it is pot luck with what you get. Overall the rooms are very clean and comfortable, some have showers only, some with separate baths and showers, and others with a shower over the bath. If you like a lie in be sure to take ear plugs. The hotel is located next to the church clock tower, which starts it's chimes early in the morning (I think it was 7 o'clock but may have been earlier on Sunday) and chimes every fifteen minutes thereafter. Breakfast were very good, plentiful with lots of choice. For the first two nights we went out to eat but on the last two we chose the half board option. You can book this in the morning but you do have to choose what you want off the menu at that time. This option is very good value for money, the choice and the food were both very good. Staff at the hotel were very helpful and pleasant. The hotel has free parking at a nearby underground car park. This is a lovely part of Italy that I'll be sure to visit again, if I do I will more than likely stay at this hotel again. Room Tip: Height of some rooms on top floor compromised by sloping ceiling.

One evening there was nothing that I would eat on the menu and he suggested a few alternatives which I thought was good. To be honest we went from here on to a 4 star hotel in the lakes and we both reckon on a value for money basis, we should have stayed at the Cavallino - a great find!",family,POS

On arrival they gave us several brochures about things to do in the local area. The service from front desk staff to maid service was some of the best I have ever experienced. We were here 5 nights and spent most our days hiking. We chose to do 1/2 board during our stay. Having dinner at the hotel made this stop even more relaxing. The meals were fantastic, breakfast and dinner. We took advantage of the spa as well, very special. Nice to have access to a washer and dryer, very convenient. The town is very nice, clean, quiet, picturesque, etc. We rode the chair lift in town and hiked back to town, it was very well marked and beautiful. The bus stop was close to the hotel and made it easy to go to Alpe de Suisse and to Bolzano. I would recommend this location and hotel to anyone looking for a place to relax, do some hiking and sightseeing, eat good, feel special and get spoiled for a few days.",family,POS
“Really very close to perfection”,"Since a long time I was told that “La Perla” Hotel in Corvara was a special place. For years, I just peeped at it with a mix of deference and curiosity while passing by, skiing in the winter and strolling in the summer during my holidays in the Dolomites. In the mean time, being registered to the mailing list, I begun to read the blog of Michil Costa, member of the owner family, talented writer, brilliant animator of the Corvara sport and cultural life and pleasant figure of a 21st century dandy. This summer, at last, I decided t stay at “La Perla” for a six days holiday. The qualities of this Hotel go far beyond its four stars, and probably even beyond very many five stars, “La Perla” is really a very special place to stay. Here, every customer is constantly at the center of a world of skillful attentions, making his staying not a simple holiday, but a memorable experience. More than a hotel, “La Perla” is a self standing museum of the Dolomites craft and traditions. Every single ambient is almost maniacally cured to build up the warm climate of an ideal mountain lodge, hundreds (if not thousands) of different original objects cleverly populate every corner of this unique collection. This traditional look sacrifices some of the fringes one is used in contemporary top class establishments: no mini-bar in the rooms, safe and room keys still in solid metal to be turned in the keyhole, wi-fi connection not completely spread all over … But these are details only. Far more important, the friendly and constant presence of the owner Costa family and a very large staff, at least double of the reasonably expected. The effort of putting the customer at ease is perceivable at any moment; most of the personnel are used to call the customer by family name and even title (this last being perhaps alarming during a holiday!). The food is particularly cured as well, there are three different restaurants: the lounge for resident customers, the gourmand Michelin-starry “La Stua de Michil” and the more informal “Ostaria Murin” (this last works as an extremely cozy after-ski bar during the winter season). The cooking is cleverly creative, with frequent glances to the local tradition; the presentation and the service are impeccable. The wine list is simply huge, with hundreds of different labels to satisfy every curiosity and financial availability. Many bottles could show better off in a museum than in a hotel cellar, in particular here is the world biggest collection of the “Sassicaia” super-tuscan, with some Mathusalems listed over € 7000. The bar is very well equipped with all different spirits and there is always live music entertainment in the evening. The spa is cozy and well maintained; there is as well a decent size open-air swimming pool in the summer with a pleasant relaxing lawn. Sport and cultural activities are organized every day. The Costa family is deeply engaged in a charity project for Tibet and this is remembered in many ways at the Hotel. In conclusion, the fares are proportional for a 4-5 stars hotel in the Dolomites area, but at “La Perla” a much bigger value is undoubtedly achieved.",couple,POS

“One of the best”,La Perla is one of the most friendly and enjoyable places we have ever stayed and the influence of the Costa family is reflected in every aspect of the hotel. We enjoyed every minute of our stay over five days and plan to return next year. We thoroughly recommed it as an exceptionally good base for summer walking in the Dolomites.,couple,POS
“An utterly charming hotel”,"This hotel truly did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived the welcome was warm and throughout the service was quite possibly the best I have ever experienced. The staff are friendly and fun, always watched over by the owners who take a hands on role in the hotel, therefore keeping standards high. The food is fabulous, we opted for half board, which included a 4-5 course meal every night. It was excellent value, but if you don't want to eat so richly it is possible just to take B&B and have one or two courses in the bar instead in the evening. The bar was always lively and convivial, with a guitarist playing popular music both before and after dinner. English was spoken widely throughout the hotel, even most of the European clientele, which put us Brits to shame! The Spa was good, with a lovely adults only sauna and relaxation area. I had an excellent massage. The rooms are pleasant, though perhaps not 5* standard and the bathrooms functional. The real quality of this hotel is the staff and the wonderful way the family run it, there was a delightful relaxed and welcoming atmosphere throughout. I havn't enjoyed a ski holiday as much as this, in fact this hotel goes into my top 10, loved every minute of it!",couple,POS
“Ideal hotel for those who love the mountains and good life.”,"I spent three nights in La Perla with my husband and other two adult family members and we all think that we would like to bo back for another holiday and spend more days. La Perla is a combination of elegance and tradition in the most exquisite style. Food is excellent and bedrooms are very good indeed. I would recomend it for those who love walking in the mountains and having a relaxed wondeful evening at the hotel, first in the spa, then going to the bar and after that having a dinner of delicatessen. The personnel is very professional and sympathetic.",family,POS
“Fantastic”,"We were here for four wonderful nights in June. Our ages range from 19-63 and everyone loved it here. They have guided hiking tours and suggested driving tours and museum suggestions as well. Food was unbelievable and breakfast and dinner were included in the price. We kept thinking we would try the Michelin one star La Stua but the menues for the included dinner were always so good we never made it to the more expensive choice. The rooms are very very comfortable, great beds! The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. I hope to return very soon to this special spot! ncc, Illinois",friends,POS
“Peace and relaxation”,"Residing in this inn is like being with family and friends who cater to your every moment with sincere smiles filled with love.

We travel to many locations throughout the world only to find we cannot live without our Hotel LaPerla. Each time we leave we are sad, but know we will return in one year if not sooner.

“High marks for Hotel Cavallino d'Oro”,"With only one night in Castelrotto, we wished we had more time to stay at Hotel Cavallino d'Oro. This picturesque property is deserving of all the praise I had read from other reviewers. The staff was warm, professional, and attentive. The hotel has old world charm without sacrificing any modern conveniences (... elevator, hairdryer, digital safe, cable tv, etc). Guests have access to the hotel's reserved spaces in an adjacent underground parking garage - covered parking in a brightly lit secured lot with elevator access, all at no charge. Breakfast was a real treat. And, despite being a stone's throw from the church bell tower, we never noticed the chimes from inside our room.",couple,POS
“Great stay”,"Welcoming and pleasant, upon arrival one immediately feels that this is a good choice. The Hotel itself is very nicely decorated both inside and out. The location is directly on the small city square behind the church bell tower. When you walk in and inquire that you have a reservation they great you with your name. My room was a single and therefore not really large, but it was adequate and again nicely decorated. I had a window view out the back balcony to the mountains. Services were fine and the sauna very nice. The reception has a large sitting area with TV, bar and very pleasant bartender. Breakfast was excellent. The Hotel also has private parking included. Overall, a great stay.",None,POS
“Lovely hotel in a picturesque town”,"The Cavallino d'Oro was a wonderful place to stay in Tirolean Castlerotto. It's right on the main square, next to the beautiful town church (and perfect cemetery). The hotel is immaculate, the staff helpful, and the rooms are charming - fitted with hand-painted Tirolean furnishings. Breakfast is good, and the restaurant is also above-average, particularly if you favor game. We rate this hotel as the best lodging value of our trip.",couple,POS
“Magical Place”,"We stayed at the Cavallino d'Oro for four nights in September 2011. This was the third time we have visited this hotel and hope to have many more visits! The property is gorgeous with attention to detail everywhere, from the beautiful flower boxes on the exterior to the painted doors and cupboards in the hotel rooms. They have added additional living space in the bar where it feels like home relaxing before and after meals. Stefan is the proud owner and LOVES his guests which adds to the charm of the entire experience. Being there in September, the village had a lot of hikers passing through and then it became very quiet in the evenings. This was the end of our trip and the Cavallino allowed us to just relax and enjoy the beauty of the Dolomites!",friends,POS
“Friendly Staff-Beautiful Location”,"Our experience here was wonderful for a variety of reasons. Upon arriving, we were running a little behind schedule and feeling a little stressed from driving/navigating in a foreign country. I told Suzanne at the front desk that I had a reservation for two and she said, """"Corrie?"""" I was pleasantly surprised that she was already so well acquainted with the guests. Suzanne was wonderful all around. She probably spoke five different languages and flowed easily between them with guests. A nice young man took our bags to the room, and the provided parking felt very safe and was a comfortable distance from the hotel. The breakfast was delicious and was a perfect way to start the morning before a lovely hike recommended by another woman at the desk. We also enjoyed the sunset from the nearby hill, a spot recommended to us by another staff member. We were also pleased to discover they provide complementary use of a washer and dryer. We were finishing up the first week of a 3 1/2 week trip and thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to freshen our wardrobe. I would highly recommend this hotel for all travelers. The decor was also very charming, and the window boxes were all very well-maintained and in lovely-full-bloom. Luckily the bell does not chime through the whole night, as we could almost reach out the window and touch the bell tower. I believe it started up again at 7 am, so either bring ear plugs or enjoy the charm of waking to a bell ring.",couple,POS
“Wonderful Stay”,"We stayed at the Cavellino D'oro May 30-June 1 with our 11 yr old daughter. It was a wonderful experience for all of us. The hotel is charming, clean and all staff were very helpful...and happy to speak English. We took half-board = breakfast & dinner,. It was excellent. We enjoyed a hike in the high Alpine Meadow (where the cable car & chairlift takes the hard work out of climbing). Our daughter had two horse riding sessions at the nearby Unterlanzin stables, arranged by the hotel. The Oswald von Wolkenstein tournament was great fun. Castelrotto is quite beautiful. I recommend it as a respite in the middle of any hectic Italian tour. We drove to Castelrotto, but the local bus service is also very user friendly. One often uses the bus when hiking to connect between different trails and chairlifts. Busses, chairlifts, and trails are quite easy to navigate & the hotel staff are happy to help with schedules. There were not many children in the hotel during our stay, but it is very family friendly. There is even a free washing machine!",family,POS
“Great hotel with so much charm!”,"Stayed for 3 nights in this adorable hotel. It was our favorite of a 17 day trip to Austria & northern Italy. Booked it based on the reviews here and it lived up to our expectations. The rooms have such charm, the lobby area is cozy, and the hosts Stefan & Susanne are by far the most friendly we've ever met! Our room had a beautiful (and comfy) 4 poster bed, a sitting area and a large balcony to enjoy the view of the Dolomites. The room was large & very clean! We traveled with another couple and our request for rooms near each other was accomodated. Front desk staff was very helpful in suggesting hikes for us and places to go. Food was good too...had dinner there one night and breakfast each day. Free use of the washer/dryer was a godsend as this was the halfway point of our trip. Plus it allowed us to chat up fellow travelers as we did laundry. Will definately stay here again when we return.",friends,POS

“This is a gem!!”,"We stayed in Castelrotto for 3 nights and did not want to leave. This hotel was a perfect place to relax after a day of hiking or driving around this beautiful part of Italy. The owners and staff were all very helpful and friendly. The room was superb!! Spacious, clean and modern, yet so cute and romantic. The bar was very nice, as well as a sitting area off the bar. The food was excellent in their restaurant and we ate there every night. They had lots of local and seasonal choices and the wine list was also great. We can't say enough good things about our stay here. Parking was underground and very convenient to the hotel. Breakfasts were bountiful. We want to return.",couple,POS
“Great lunch”,"After a week in Dobbiaco, we did the superb Prato Piazza bus and up and walk back down the end of this valley road and had lunch afterwards at the Tuscherhof. Excellent!

"“Old and tired, but good”","We had visited the Braies/Plätzwiese area before, but never stayed in Hotel Hohe Gaisl which lookes pretty romantic and inviting from the outside. This summer we reserved the """"penthouse suite"""" which must be South Tirolian slang for: a huge attic with a balcony. The people that are running the hotel are provenly old and tired. Welcoming us seemed to take the last breath of the lady of the house. Although we were immediately correctly identified without asking our names, the rest of check-in was pure operations and extremely to-the-point. After having found the elevator and the room ourselves (one additional stair to climb in the room itself; no problem), we entered this huge attic. As per our request two additional beds had been placed in the room, in what we thought (from their website) was a kitchen area. The beds and their location was perfect, however in this area of the room only partly curtains were available. It turned out that our kids would wake up at around 5am at sunrise. The hotel adressed the situation quite adequately by covering the concerned windows with black plastic waste bags. That worked, although the level of McGyver was quite big regarding the price we paid for the room (EUR 400 per night). The furniture in the room definitely requires replacement. Couches in the room are old and worn out sleeping couches that are now only in use to sit on....although the wooden arm rests are dangerously loose. In the Dolomites we think you should not sit on your behind inside too long, so for us it was a minor issue we laughed away, but again for the price you pay. Beds were in perfect shape and a delight to sleep on, although some might find them a bit on the hard side. Sound: no sound, repeat, no sound. Not interior, not exterior. Howver, it did rain (and hale and thunder) one night and rain drops falling on some windows integrated in the slope of roof made quite some noise; we considered it romantic! The actual big unique selling point of Hohe Gaisl must be its full pension mealplan. Breakfast buffet is huge and good, afternoon Tea provides a really vast choice of cakes, cookies, soup etc. and dinner is enormous. We found the quality of the foods not to be """"haut cuisine"""", but very good. Daily menus provide lots of variation as well. What we actually were missing was the enthusiasm among the staff. They appear tired and bored, certainly not unfriendly though. There was hardly any attempt to make personal contact (except one waitress who tried to communicate in a very funny with our kids; they do not speak any Italian). Would I come here again, well only because the Dolomites and particularly the Platzwiese is such a wonderfull place to be and the Platzwiese is otherwise quite difficult to reach (without being packed iwith the masses n the shuttle bus). Hohe Gaisl owns the monopoly here if you are looking for something beyond a youth hostel.",family,NEG
“Certainly Far From the Madding Crowd!”,"All in all a very enjoyable place to stay. The rooms are spotless, we were given an (unsought) upgrade from standard to superior without any extra charge, the staff are very professional (if a little on the chilly side, but then this is more Austria than Italy!), the swimming pool and sauna are superb, the masseuse is highly skilled, and the scenery and setting of unparalleled beauty. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the food. You have to take half-board and the dinner, while posing as haute cuisine, isn't bad so much as boring. They tell you in the brochure that you can ask for a vegetarian or even """"ethical"""" meal, but we certainly weren't ever asked our opinion... Still, all in all I can thoroughly recommend this place for a truly restful couple of days """"far from the madding crowd"""" (especially after the daytrippers have all caught the last bus home). A couple of tips: Do try the barman's special bubbly and elderflower cocktail. And remember to print your confirmation e-mail and take it with you because the whole natural parl area is closed to normal traffic and you have to show your reservation at the bottom of the mountain. Otherwise they make you walk the SIX uphill kilometres to the hotel !!! Room Tip: Ask for a room on the front. The view's amazing and the double glazing ensures things stay quiet...

“A Hotel with A View”,"Our family spent 4 nights here. We stayed in the Panorama suite and enjoyed the very spacious room with a stunning view of the mountains! An old stylish place, but with everything (and more!) we could expect! We spent the days hiking in the surrounding mountains after being served a big breakfast buffet. In the afternoon we would return for the lunch soup, before spending some time in the pool. Later we got ready for a the good 3-coarse dinner. PS: They also have a bar/cafe serving drinks and food outside. Right by the hotel is a shelter with a little playground for the kids. Phone connection is (very) poor. Wifi in the reception area only. I guess that is good - time should be spent otherwise in a place like this :-)",family,POS
“Disappointing”,"The location of this hotel, right in front of a beautiful and pristine alpine lake, is wonderful. If you are looking for a peaceful spot, the location is fantastic. Hiking opportunities in the area are first-rate, as virtually everywhere else in Alto Adige. However, the overall experience was not so outstanding. I and my family spent four nights in this hotel, in three different rooms. Another reviewer mentioned nice remodelled rooms. My brother had one of those, and indeed the room was beautiful, with an oustanding lake view and satellite TV. My parents had a nice room too, but not as nice as my brother's (no TV, for instance). My room, on the other hand, was on a non-remodeled wing of the hotel, and hence not so nice (quaint likely describes it better). Mind, all rooms were clean, but in July 2008 a large part of the hotel is in the middle of remodeling, and most of the hotel is in a state of disarray, with old furniture and random objects scattered around dark corridors, malfunctioning lights. The faucet of my bathroom's sink was kept together with tape, the shower had no hook to hang the showerhead, so I had to keep it in my hands while showering. There was no reading light next to the bed (just a 6-7 inch tall lamp). The room was separated by the neighbour's room by a thin wall, so I would hear every word he would say (luckily, he was a very quiet guest). But all this would have been OK if the dinner had been what I expected. This area of Italy has a very particular and excellent culinary tradition, and you pretty much all hotels will give you excellent samples of it. Not this one. Dinner would invariably offer a very mediocre and thin selections of NON-local preparations, the kind of stuff (both in terms of quality and kind) you would expect from a third-rate """"Italian"""" restarant OUTSIDE of Italy. In four days, we were offered not a single local dish, and everything except the salad was mediocre at best. The breakfast, on the other hand, was abundant and very good. Service was often VERY slow and not very friendly, depending on which waiter you would get. One morning no one showed up to bring coffee. One night my parents were still waiting for their entree while I got mine 20 minutes earlier. You often had to wait 10 minutes or so before someone would show up to bring you water and drinks. So, overall a very mixed experience, not terrible, but not positive either. I would not go back. My advice is choose another hotel or go to a B&B (usually excellent and inexpensive in the area) and explore restaruants. And, if you really want to stay in this hotel, do make sure you can get a renovated room and keep your expectations VERY low for dinner... You can have much better deals for the same (or less) money. It's the first time in MANY years of vacations spent in the area that I am so disappointed with my lodging (which, on the other hand, also say VERY good things about the area).",family,NEG
“The Highlight of our Trip to Italy!!!”,"My husband and I, along with 2 friends, enjoyed our stay tremendously at the Hotel Lago di Braies. The setting of the hotel is more breathtakingly beautiful than I ever imagined! Our rooms had been recently remodeled and were immaculate and comfortable, with gorgeous views of the lake. The dining was local food and quite good. We were at this hotel at the very end of their season, which meant there were very few people, and the resulting peace and quiet was a rare treat. Because they were not having to take care of lots of guests, we enjoyed the attention of the innkeepers, Caroline and her husband Jens, who were charming and incredibly accommodating. We spent one day hiking on the many trails in the area, and were overwhelmed by the majestic scenery. This is a very special place!!",couple,POS
“Recommended”,"Wonderful room, everything very clean, very good breakfast. The hotel is located 5 km from Merano and 20 km from Bolzano, a position very useful to visit these two beautiful cities, and also the ropeway to the ski slopes is just 5 km far from the hotel.

“Wonderful place to stay”,"Excellent accommodation with a truly welcoming hostess. We really enjoyed our 3-night stay in Postal. The room had to be the largest hotel room we have ever stayed in. The 'room' had sleeping area, dining area, sitting room, walk-in closet and a large bathroom. It was all very nicely furnished, with pleasing touches everywhere. It also had its own patio/sitting area with wonderful mountain views. Our room was on the ground floor, with access to the adjacent to the pool. Everything was very clean and proper with a great atmosphere. Breakfast was included in the price and it offered high quality food with ample choice. Also available is free, underground parking with space for 20 vehicles. One added bonus for a small hotel was the elevator. We were encouraged to use anything from the dining room such as silverware, condiments, plates, bowls etc if we chose to dine in our room. The hotel is well-situated, with easy access to the most stunning scenery the Dolomites have to offer.

It was clean, spacious and very up to date. The other staff was also very nice even though they didn't speak English or much English. They were always trying to help and we did fine communicating with google translate for what I needed. Everyone was very nice, polite, friendly and the hotel was clean.

Our room on the front of the hotel had a magnificent view of the mountains and a warm sunny spacious balcony. The indoor pool is very pleasant, very clean and well-maintained and a great asset in the latter part of the season.. Dinners are excellent and the menu did not repeat itself at all during the eleven days we were there. The welcome we received from all the family was faultless - we even had helpful advice in advance on planning our journeys and also on planning our walks in the area. As one of us has walking difficulties this was very valuable. We now plan to return a third time - what better recommendation could there be?",couple,POS

The dinner cook must be a superstar for dinner consisted of amazingly delicious servings one after the other. I would highly recommend this hotel to all who are visiting Scena",couple,POS
“Superb !”,"We made this hotel our base for a couple of days while we motorcycle toured the Alps. The owners were very helpful with routes and advice before we came and then were very welcoming and hospitable when we arrived. Our room was large and very comfortable with a large well equipped bathroom and a balcony with a view of the valley and mountains. We also used the pool, steam room and sauna to wind down at the end of the day. The meals were generous , well cooked and imaginative, all served in a lovely dining room with views over the valley. The location at Schenna is a little gem, overlooking Merano and the surrounding mountains. There is a regular cheap bus service to Merano centre that stops across the road and the journey is short. So all in all we could highly recommend this hotel, we certainly plan to return! Room Tip: I think all rooms have a view of the valley, but make sure you do as it is fantastic!

"“High Hopes, Disappointing Experience”","We actually stayed here during July 2009 for an extended weekend and wanted to give a quick review before it got too late. The pictures from the hotel's web site looked exactly like what we look for in a vacation in South Tirol: Modern architecture, great setting with 'green' for the dog, trekking possibilities nearby, promises of great food and wine etc. But it was not so for us. Although the hotel belongs to the Belvita hotel group and touts 4+ stars, we were not given a room in the new, modern tract due to our companion dog. So strike new bathroom, clean lines and interesting architecture. We had an older room in the not-yet-renovated main house (albeit spacious and with a great view) whose furniture was dog-eared and whose bathroom had seen several decades of travelers. It also had no air conditioning which we desperately needed due to the afternoon Summer sun from the balcony. Although there was enough space for a quick necessity-driven walk for the dog, there were not so many interesting trails directly near to the hotel for our hikes. We, instead, drove to the destinations and sought out suitable trails with the help of the staff. (Plus points here: they were nice and helpful.) And regarding the food: although the set up was what one could expect with half-board for the area, the meals lacked the fine touches to be truly good--although the descriptions always sounded luscious. Plus, the terrace where we often had pre-dinner drinks needed to be refurbished, too. The old (70's early '80's?) main building, terrace and decor of the dining room didn't fit with the modern glass room tract and the avantgarde touches in the hotel reception's lounge area. Probably the renovation couldn't be done all at once due to costs, but we felt the hotel needed a bit more 'pepping up' in general. A new area of South Tirol discovered, but we needn't return here as there are plenty of other options out there. Ones that don't assign the run-down rooms to people with dogs.",couple,NEG
“Hotel with Heart”,"We stayed for 7 nights at the beginning of July. This was my first time, but my siblings and dad have stayed at Golserhof many times over the past 2 decades. The owners create a family like atmosphere. The hotel has a lot of charm. The dinners are amazing. The hotel offers guided hikes several times a week. We participated in 3 of the hikes and were very pleased with each of the hikes. Patrick and Luis the two guides are very knowledgeable about the area and are happy to make suggestions of other hikes you may want to do on your own. Each knows a lot about the plants you see along the trails. The fitness center is limited both in equipment and hours. The Spa offers a variety of treatments, but there are some opportunities to improve the service and ambience. I hope I will have an opportunity to return at some point. All staff we interacted with were extremely helpful and friendly. We loved Peter and Jozef. Room Tip: I don't think there are any bad rooms. See more room tips",family,NEG

The Hotel was very clean and comfortable with a lovely sauna steamroom facility for relaxing after a hard day of skiing. The food in the restaurant was outstanding with the menu changing each night abundant with choices of delectable alternatives. The best feature of the hotel was Monika and her staff. They bent over backwards to make everything perfect, even so far as to send 3 cars to pick up some stranded members of our group who had miss a bus connection. Altogether on a value for money scale this is as good as it gets.",friends,POS
"“Utterly charming, could have stayed a week or longer!”","After a five hour drive from Munich by way of Neuschwanstein, we were ready to accept flat beer and lumpy beds. To our delight, the Gasthof exceeded all expectations. Nestled in the Alps, we experienced delight at the spacious rooms with all necessary appointments (plus bidet!) and a shared balcony. We spent a few hours in the afternoon sun playing board games and drinking cold local beer in the beautiful garden. We delighted in the three billy goats and their gruffness. The sauna is hot and fantastically soothing after a day on the road. Service was, in all cases, polite and observant and they are all genuinely wonderful folks! We recommend the full board - dinner, veal escalope and mushroom dumplings? Amazing. Breakfast is the full continental with fresh breads, meats, cheeses, fruits, I could go on forever! Also the GIGANTIC children's park next door reminded me of my childhood, with forts, ziplines, spinners, teetertotters - the works! Bottom Line: This hotel is for all comers. If you are looking for a night's rest as a solo traveler, they have you covered. If you are looking for an extended stay, or you are traveling with children, they have you extra covered.",couple,POS
“Our only mistake was not staying longer!”,"My husband and I traveled to the South Tyrol with another couple as part of a longer trip to a number of different cities. Villabassa was off the beaten path, but on our way to Venice so we stopped for just an evening. If we had only known how beautiful the village, the hotel and the parkland here is, we would have stayed much longer. We have no complaints. The rooms were spacious and well-appointed. The food was excellent. The staff was friendly and warm. We enjoyed drinking wine under the arbor in front of the house and enjoyed even more the extensive children's park down the lane a bit -- with huge slides, zip lines, jungle gyms, teeter-totters, monkey bars, wobbly wooden bridges and every awesome playground feature that Americans have gotten rid of because of over-litigious parents. There were numerous trails for walks and hikes which we didn't have time to avail ourselves of, and a small, quietly picturesque town center. I would go back in a heartbeat and I recommend it absolutely to families with children or anyone looking for a restful spot in the Alto Adige region.",couple,POS

“Nice hotel”,"We stayed here for 1 night in late September. Its a nice hotel and our room felt as if we were staying with a family rather than in a hotel. Our room faced the front, over a busy cobbled street however, and it was very noisy all night long (we had the patio door open). I imagine if you closed the door it would have been quieter but it would also have been stuffy and hot. If you chose a room at the back you would be overlooking the restaurant, which was also noisy. There was a large balcony with chairs and a view of the church and mountain. Sunday morning the church bells rang for 10 minutes - it was lovely but there would have no chance to sleep in if that was your plan. The restaurant is great though and we enjoyed are really nice meal there. Room Tip: Rooms facing the cobblestone road are quite noisy. See more room tips",couple,NEG

Although we were able to sample the magnificent breakfast each morning - which included champagne on Sunday morning! we wished we had more time to fully appreciate the indoor and outdoor pools, and superb spa area with sauna complex. We would have no hesitation in recommending this extremely well run and friendly family run hotel.

"“Nice location and rooms, expected more from dinner”","Stayed here for one night on a trip through Alto Adige. I was lucky to get a room on short notice, so I won't complain for the relatively high price. The half board included dinner, but being in a region of great food and wine my expectations were maybe too high. I would say the food was average. The live entertainment provided some distraction, so overall not too bad. The deluxe room in the traditional wing was nicely appointed and quite new. The view was mostly of the courtyard, so it's best to check ahead where the room is located. The property is quite large and includes a pool, volley ball, outdoor dining. The spa area closes too early to make use of it after a long day. However, bike rental are free. We were not able to get the Wifi to work on any of our plentiful devices, but that may have been a temporary glitch. All in all, would I go back, but would shop around a bit next time.

“Average”,"Lots of groups. You're not exactly in a little mountain village here. It's not quaint, but it is within a 20 or 30-minute drive of the mountains. If you want a quaint, South Tyrol experience, you should probably book a smaller hotel. The employees at the reception are very friendly. The bed was too hard for me, and the pillow too flat. A very simple salad bar is available for 5 euros. A good value if you eat a light dinner. The offer gluten-free items for breakfast, but they're not what I would have liked. At least they have something, though. Parking is free. Room Tip: Try to get a room that's not on the street side. See more room tips",friends,NEG
"“Ok to sleep over, but dare to eat!!”","Room was ok, Hotel seems to be maintained but don't expect too much. Beware of the restaurant or the breakfast! We tried a two course dinner. I ordered a cheese plate and my wife a caprese with ham. Well, and that was exactly what we got. No arrangement on the plate, no spices or herbs, nor any vinegar or olive-oil. The bread at the buffet seemed in the need of a chain saw to get it sliced. Our second course consisted of pre-grilled meat heated up in a microwave. Over cooked and again NO taste at all. But all that has been topped by the tremendous breakfast buffet we found the other day. About 5 slices of cheese aside the same amount of sausage. After 10 minutes someone able to cook an egg showed up. The bread and rolls were at least 24 hours old. everything was thrown on plates without any love and served without it either.

Great for pensioners in the huts or caravan park. Brillant pools are great for kids, indoor in winter and outdoor for summer. Rooms are very very tiny and it is hard with suitcases and kids.

“Do not stay there”,"We stayed in Steiner hotel for one day only but I will remember this unpleasant experience for a while yet. The main hotel looks nice but we were put in a separate additional building. The building smelled of rubbish. Room was relatively clean but was very small and the window opened to pizzeria, hence additional smell of food. The bathroom was even smaller to the point that it was difficult to move. We were there on a hot day and the hotel doesn’t have air conditioning or fan so it was sticky and hot. Window blinds needed to be closed for shade, but this meant no fresh air. We came at 3pm and there was no one in reception to help us with anything other that keys till 6pm (advertised as 24 hour reception). Our passports were left on top of the bench with nobody even watching them. We tried to get (advertised) access to internet but again not till 6 pm. When we finally got some help after 6 (meaning that we wasted 3 hours waiting around), the lady at reception was not really friendly and communication (in English) was nearly impossible. To top this hotel is on a very busy road and road noise never stops so a good sleep is not possible.",family,NEG
“Perfect view and spa”,"From each balcony the view spreads over the city of meran and the villages and above them the mountains with their regional typically steep flanks. The hotel is located just at the beginning of the small village of Tirol above the city of Meran. It's bordering the wine yards. The location ensures a perfect view and silence. The rooms are well sized, but not exactly large. All feature the same view. The spa and the outside swimming pool are excellent. The spa offers a large variety. Dinner is included and served in the main restaurant. The food is without exception very good and with ample diversity. Service is top notch and very friendly. The wireless internet access – which seems to be a fairly new offering – is not up-to-date. Only one hour is included and requires each time a kind of registration. If you have more the one device... bad luck for the second device or take the expensive daily option. Disappointing is the fact that smoking at the bar is still on-going and at least one evening the smoke was noticeable in the gourmet restaurant, which is located one floor above the bar.

The interior of the rooms is somewhat old fashioned and some modern design would certainly make a positive difference, nevertheless they are quite comfortable. Breakfast was good and offered a very good veriety of food. The rooms come with half board, i. e. dinner which was tasty although somewhat conservative. The hotel has a Michlin-star restaurant offering very good and innovative cooking. Service staff is mixed, some very attentive and some scatterbrained. Negative experiences were the Euro 5 charge for internet use, the 45 min wait for room service with an extra Euro 20 service charge for the room service. Also the lunch menu on the terrace was limited to the hours of 12:30 to 1:45 pm, outside of this time bracket there were about 4 boring dishes available, 3 of them cold.

We had an „Edelweiss Suite A“ for the three of us with a large bedroom and a likewise sitting room, also the bathroom and the balcony were very spacious. Breakfast was good, with a rich variety of goods. Dinner was always a highlight! We were on halfboard and that was probably the best one we ever had. Every dish was a culinary delight and I have to point out that our familiy is very spoiled as far as fine food is concerned. Once there was also an aperitif where fancy drinks and food were offered.

Clean, roomy, with a good secure locker room, handy for the lift (200 mtrs.), lots of parking, fun bar and little supermarket nearby and 10 mins walk from the (limited facilities) village. Mountain restaurants provide not only good food, but good value too. I didn't try the breakfasts at the residence but they are provided at about E7. For Brits it's best to think of this as southern Austria rather than northern Italy – the self catering apartments really mean self catering and may not have a kettle (or toaster), but could well have a coffee percolator. If you're driving, perhaps take a trip through the town up into the hills to check out the church on the hill – if you're likely to be interested in such things!",None,POS

The rooms were tidy, but not spacious and the last renovation was years ago, i.e. functional but not as exclusive as the price. For € 130.- per night for a double room you can definitely expect some luxury - which we founs during our trip for less.

There was a brother and sister team whose names I cannot recall now but they took one look at our ragged bike tired faces and did everything they could to get us comfortable. Food was amazing. We got an extra portion especially for us as we had skipped lunch and got lost and were so famished. Great local wine to go with it was also recommended to us as well as schnapps shots with the brother and other guests! For the price, you can't beat it. We didn't have a lot of time here as we arrived in the evening and left early in the morning but what time we did have at the hotel was really very lovely. Good attention to detail with the rooms and service. Our room looked at the Dolomities and honestly...stay here. It's well worth it.

The hotel itself, the lobby and each floor are decorated very nicely, so you really get a special feeling staying there. Stuff is very kind, attentive and helpful.

“A gold mine in Dobbacio !”,"A month long bicycle tour of northern Italy,Austria and Slovenia began at the amazing Weberhof. It was like hitting the jackpot from three perspectives and with a price that reflected incredible value. #1: The hotel is located in a quiet section of the village giving it a pastoral setting with a magnificent view of the surrounding mountains and valleys. #2: The bedroom,gallery, kitchen and separate bath were comfortable, spacious and airy. It was wonderful to start the day with a nuzzle from the friendly family donkey ! #3: The real magic begins downstairs with a tiny stand-up bar and a rustic dining-room with a 5 star menu. One should stay several days not only to enjoy the spectacular scenery but also to explore the amazing potential of the 1/2 board option and the creativity of the owner-chef. It was with disappointment that we moved on after 5 days for the balance of the trip but the hospitality and the value of our stay at the Weberhof remain as golden memories.

"“Comfortable hotel, excellent food and wine”","We spent 2 nights at this lovely hotel in the Sud-Tirol. Our room was spacious and well furnished though I found the fact that every surface was covered with promotional literature a little irritating.However it was easy enough to gather it all up into a pile so that we had somewhere to put our stuff. We had a spacious balcony overlooking the terrace with lovely views of the mountains and a large bathroom with walk-in shower. We were staying on half-board terms. The selection at breakfast was amazing with lots of homemade produce such as yoghurt. Dinner was 3 courses preceded by a salad bar which was really a meal in itself. There is no choice for the 3 courses but we did not find that a problem as we do not have any food dislikes or allergies. The quality of the food and its presentation was outstanding. We also sampled the wine from the estate which, although not cheap, is excellent. We hope to buy some more on-line as we could only manage to carry 2 bottles home. While we were there we were invited along with the other guests to a sampling in the wine cellar. This included tasting some of the wines and enjoying some very tasty snacks. This was free and on top of the salad bar and 3 course dinner. We had assumed that it took the place of the salad bar. The only slightly negative aspect of our stay was service but this may have been because of language difficulties. We speak reasonable Italian but the staff will only speak German which I don't speak at all though my husband made a decent fist of recalling his schoolboy German. The hotelier however speaks excellent English though he is not always around. Like a previous reviewer we got caught out by the eau de vie at the end of the meal. Unfortunately the one we chose the first night was 11 euros a glass (little more than a thimbleful) and the one on the second night was 8 euros. So be warned and ask the price before making your choice. Although the other hotels we stayed in during this holiday had eau de vie on display nowhere else were they brought round to the table as a matter of course.

This is the fourth time I have been snowboarding in this area, and our stay at this hotel is really worth noting because of its particular friendliness. Although rated three star, as another reviewer has stated, it has four star service. Augusto and Sabine, the owners, make you feel right at home, and the limited staff become familiar friends as the week goes by. We stayed with mezza pensione, so breakfast and dinner were included, and our server, Irene, accommodated my dietary limitations in the nicest ways, always remembering what I could not eat, but also what I liked! We stayed in the superior room 402 on the top floor. I believe this is one of the largest rooms in the hotel, and easily fits a family of four, though we were just one couple. We loved the romantic four poster bed and chose this over some of the more modern decorated rooms available. The view from the huge window facing the mountain and the ski lift at san cassiano was so beautiful we actually did a timelapse photo/video from it so we could remember it. The hotel has a deal with the ski rental at the bottom of the lift (just 300 meters' walk away anyway) so you can store your equipment there for the week.

This hotel is in an absolutely incredible location - view out our window looked straight to the back mountains, snow, bliss. The rooms are perfect - cleaning staff comes every day promptly at 10am to clean. We didn't watch t.v. much while we were there, but they do have a flat screen and it gets satellite (so BBC, CNN) if you want to keep up with the news. The food is amazing - six courses every night. Breakfast also wonderful. The spa is divine - they have a steam room, sauna, two whirlpools and a small swimming pool. Only slight annoyance was kids being pretty loud playing in the pool when others are trying to lounge and read, but they are just kids being kids, so can't complain about that too much :) Try to go a bit later in the evening - right before dinner the spa is top time.

The hotel itself has an olde worldy feel to it but our room (in the new wing I think) was beautiful; very spacious, modern, comfortable and with great views from the balcony. The indoor pool downstairs was great fun too. My only slight criticism would be that they didn't seem to be very prepared for guests with gluten intolerance (despite us obviously having previously asked). The easiest thing to do every day would have been for the chef to mark on the menu what was gluten free (or what could be made gluten free) and what wasn't instead of us having to ask every day about every single dish. Just a very slight blemish on an otherwise pleasant stay. I understand totally that it can be difficult to appreciate others' slight difficulties. On the plus side, the food was lovely.",family,NEG

We love San Cassiano and the location of Hotel Gran Ancei is truly in the most beautiful, natural location: close to the Armentarola ski lift and you can hike, snow shoe or sled directly out the door. The wellness area is excellent (not quite as stunning or extensive as Fanes but Gran Ancei costs half the price): terrific pool, beautiful grotto/pirates' cove of whirlpool tubs, sauna, steam room, water beds, etc. Although it is small, we never felt crowded or had any sort of wait.

Ideal for family self-catering (nearest supermarket 5 minutes away in nearby village). Breakfast was served in the hotel but the selection was let down by the number of flies in attendance.

“great time”,wonderful experience. the hotel is family run and the whole family tries to make you feel really at home and to have fun with you. They all communicate in English; their service is impeccable and the quality of both food and accommodation is first class. Almost every room has a veranda with striking views to all sides...and you can quickly get used to the bells of the nearby church (off between 11pm and 6pm).

"“One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, great location and excellent food”","Truly an amazing experience for me and my family in this hotel in the Ridanna valley of Italy's South Tyrol. I spent one week with a group of 8 eight people and we all had an incredible experience. The hotel is in one of the northernmost valleys of Italy's Alto Adige, just below Austria. It is a solitary location, but the beauty of the valley and the many activities will leave you with very little time. The rooms are excellent, we noticed that our room was in a newer part of the hotel with some additional amenities such as rolling shutters and a bigger bathroom, but we were able to see 2 other rooms from our group and they were just as excellent. The hotel provides half board, with an all-encompassing breakfast buffet and amazing gourmet dinners with a selection of main course you will choose in the morning. The fitness, spa and pool facilities are in great shape and can be used with a very wide program of free activities. Every day hikes are organized by the hotel, they can be pretty difficult, so be ready for good physical exercise. Do not miss their organized Tuesday's excursion to their mountain refuge, where they will prepare free grilled food after a 2 hour walk in a magnificent environment. We did have a minor problem with this excursion since we lost our way and the guide gave us wrong direction, but we talked to the hotel people and they are going to make maps in the future for slower hikers. Overall one of the best vacation we have ever had, truly a fantastic family operation in this hotel, where each of the 8 children of the owner Paula helps in creating an unforgettable experience.

We were there for 10 nights and the food was simply excellent every evening. Our room was superbly appointed and kept immaculately clean as you would expect in that part of the world.

“Nice family hotel at La Villa”,"I spent 3 delightful days at Hotel &Residence La Villa. The structure has an internal roo use as playground and a lovely tree house in the park in front. The first nice thing to underline is that my 2 yearold son slept in a wood baby cot instead of the travel baby cots that normaly the hotels use. The linen was soft and new. It was just perfect. The darkness of the room in the morning can assure 30 minutes more for the kids... Which I appreciate! The structure is super clean and you can see that everything was chosen with taste. The half board was very nice. The breakfast was served in a light and quiet room where you can admire the mountains, a postcard window view. The apple cake is very good. The service is not super fast, but with that view and as it self service in the morning and at nights you can take the salad or the fruit buffet while waiting it is not a big deal. They have very good wines, and absolutely not expensive that you can drink during your stay. The position from the 'ovovia' is Very good. My son loved it. The activities for children at the mountain top are really amazing. So it is very positive point that is near and you can go 5 minutes walking. One thing that was amazing is the memory of the owner, she new all the guests name! The treatment was so warm that my son is still asking for Michela! For sure I will returned!",family,POS
"“Wonderful Hotel in the Dolomites, South Tyrol Italy!”","Hotel is run by husband and wife, Peter and Michaela. They and their staff make you feel at home and appreciate that you have to visit their bit of heaven on earth. We have skied in several places in the USA on the west coast and Whistler but this is so different. If you ski in the US you could be anywhere but in the Dolomites and especially the South Tyrol area it is more than skiing. It is about ambiance. You purchase the Super Dolomiti ski pass and can ski beyond the Alta Badia area (where the hotel and town of La Villa are located). You ski from village to village, can get pulled through flat areas by a horse drawn cart, and eat gnocchi or German sausages at mountainside """"huts"""". Truly wonderful. The Hotel La Villa is conveniently located in the town of LaVilla in the heart of the ski area known as Alta Badia in the region known as South Tyrol. You need to either drive there or get to the town of Brunica/Bruneck (Italian/German name) and catch either a bus (last one at 7:20, check SAD system) or a tax - about E$80 one way. My family and I did half board and each morning we started with a filling breakfast buffet, and ended with a 3 course dinner. You choose your entree for the evening in the morning from their list. With half-board you pay for only wine, bottled water, etc. Their rooms are very nice. We had a regular room for our 19 and 21 year olds but got a slightly larger room for ourselves. Plenty of space. European frame furniture i.e. modern simplicity. Heated bathroom floors and towel racks. Plenty of space. For skiers, they will shuttle you to the mountain base every morning and pick you up in the afternoon. Only a 7-8 minute ride. They start picking up at 3:30 pm every day and just keep going until everyone is in. We never had to wait more than 5 minutes. They can also take you to a ski rental place. FYI - equipment rental and ski passes are MUCH cheaper HERE than in the US. 3 day Super Dolomiti pass was about E$60 per person per day and about the same for renting skies. The Wellness Center is a bit different than what Americans might expect - not an outdoor hot tub. Take a look online at their pics. Internet is sluggish and not worthwhile, but not a big deal unless you really need it. Lobby only really and NOT free. They have a nice bar to for post ski drinks and post dinner ambiance. Yes, stay at this place! Again the owners and staff are there for you! Room Tip: They have different room sizes. We were on the American version 2nd floor; our 19 and 21 were on 4t...

Buffet breakfast also very rich. Reasonable prices and excellent value for money are the reason why we'll be back soon. And the main reason is certainly the staff very polite and helpful.

I was immediately impressed with the sympathetic owners, the pleasant and spotless new room.The whole hotel has been renovated and can only be recommended.

“Excellent Family Hotel”,"If you are looking for theme parks, all-night clubbing or a Centre Parks style holiday then stay away. If, however, you prefer to plan your own activities (walking, cycling, paragliding, …), eat good food and sample the local wine then the village of Tirolo (Dorf Tirol) and Hotel Brunnhofer are a good choice. Most hotel guests are families or couples and like us come back year after year. The hotel is located on the periphery of Dorf Tirol and therefore quiet at night while still within good walking distance from shops and amenities. The family who owns the hotel also live there, including Sheila, the dog (rather big but very friendly). We usually stay either in the “Garni” or the Tower. Both are several 100 year old buildings with tremendously thick walls which keep the rooms cool during the hot Summer days. You could also stay in the main hotel building or in the newly built and quite luxurious 'Residence'. The hotel has its own heated swimming pool with a long water slide, an inside whirl pool and a sauna (which is closed in the Summer months). Everything is well kept and very clean. Wi-fi is available in the main hotel building. Hotel staff are very friendly and appear to be fluent in pretty much any European language. Food is excellent. For breakfast there is a buffet with a wide selection of local breads, rolls, sausages, cheeses, scrambled eggs and cereals. The hotel does not offer lunch but this is a good chance to sample some of the many restaurants and pizzerias in the village. A 4 or 5 course meal is offered for supper and you can choose between 2 or 3 options for each course. The menu changes every day so there is plenty of variation.

We opted for half board and was glad we did. 5 course gourmet meal that was so large that on the second night we requested half portions.

“What a joke!”,"We bought 2 nights on Groupon, thinking that it was a really good deal, how wrong we were! When we arrived we had to wait for the people at reception to stop talking to eachother before they helped us. No smile, no welcome, they were really unhelpful. We got up to the room and all the electricity had been switched off and obviously the unhelpful people in reception hadn't told us how to switch it on, so off we go down 3 flights of stairs to ask..... The room was like a sauna, it was so hot. None of the beds were made, and we had no bedding or towels. so we asked in reception and someone came up and handed us everything...! It is the first time in my life that I have stayed in serviced apartments and have had to make my own bed!!!! We knew that there was no restaurant, but we would have at least thought that someone at reception could have explained to us how to get the restaurant or given us a map, something !!!!! The swimming pool.. it hasn't been refurbed since the 1970's, the baby pool has the same temp. water as the big pool, the floors are so slippy, and it is generally in need of a good clean! You can get to the pool in the maze of tunnels (not signed at all !! and not explained by the staff) but none of the corridors are heated so you basically need to wear your ski suit to get the pool and when you to the changing rooms, there are no padlocks on the lockers, and they are cold! We honestly thought that our 2 year old was going to get either pneumonia or crack his head open slipping all over the place. When we checked out we were told that we had to pay €50 to clean the apartment...we stayed 2 nights!!! I double checked our Groupon voucher and it was written on the small print...I hadn't seen it.. We ended up paying more than we would have done if we had checked into a decent hotel! I would definately not reccommend this place to anyone...the staff are unfriendly, unhelpful, the pool is dangerous and cold.....the only thing that it has going for it is the location.

“A fantastic hotel in every way!”,"Eighteen years ago we were the first English visitors to this wonderful hotel. Eighteen visits later, we still cannot wait to return to our 'paradise'! In every way, this hotel is a true gem, loved by all who visit it. It is owned and run by the Schrott family, who have the welfare of their guests in mind twenty-four hours a day. From the moment you arrive, the Sonnenhof captivates you. After a warm welcome, you quickly come to love the spaciousness of the hotel and its surroundings, the lovely bedrooms with superb views over the valley and the mountains from their balconies and the beauty of lying on sunbeds in the garden or swimming in the indoor pool, with the same stunning views. After all our visits, last year we put the hotel to a different test by bringing our children and grandchildren for a celebration holiday. Even though both families had seen many photographs and heard many reports about our visits to Sud Tirol, they all said these did not do justice to the actual experience. The four grandchildren revelled in everything. They loved their rooms, the food, the walks, the photo opportunities, the cable car rides, the toboggan run on Meran 2000, the breakfast and evening meals outside on the terrace, fun in the pool and even sun bathing in the garden. As others have said the quality, variety and presentation of the evening meals is amazing and we found it incredible that, in a total of five weeks stay at the hotel last year, we did not have a single evening meal menu repeated. At the end of your day, after dinner, there is the opporunity to relax on the terrace, on your balcony or in the bar with a glass of your chosen drink. In addition, you may have the opportunity to join convivial, highly informative wine tastings run, as are the walks, by Herr Schrott. If what this hotel and its surroundings has to offer is what you want, you will have a wonderful holiday at great value.

"“lovely town, magic location, excellent value accom”","St Maddalena is a small town in a relatively untouristy part of the Dolomites, north of val Gardena. There isnt a lot to do there, but if you visit the local church you will see a view that has launched a thousand post cards. Note that there are 2 churches that could lay claim to being the most photographed in this valley, one is St Johanns ( a tiny baroque church in a field), which is clearly marked on local maps, the other is not so special for its architecture, being a simple stone spire type, but when you see it against the backdrop of the Odles (the Dolomites here), the view is unearthly beautiful. The church doesnt seem to have a name that I could find, but to get to it, follow the signs from the centre of the village. The best view of it is to be had from the road that continues on past the turn off for the church. That view alone is the reason I was in St Maddalena, and I enquired for lodgings at a few places (all full) until I chanced upon Haus Florian, run by a nice lady, and the room is lovely, and incredibly cheap at €40, but the only thing that stopped me staying longer was that at that point (mid July), a new home was being built right next door, and the builders made a racket from 7am to 6pm, which ruined the peaceful feel for me. Breakfast was continental, but as I was the only one there that day, rather on the small side. But for the price, I didnt care. If you are having a short stay in St. Magdalena, I highly recommend this place, but make sure the construction next door has completed.

One of the group was arriving a little later than the rest so could not make it for dinner, once she arrived, after midnight they had prepared a wonderfull candel-light dinner with the best of the food that we had enjoyed that evening. It is a lovely 60 room hotel with an inmense wellness area. Food is excellent; they have one of the best breakfast buffes that I have seen in mountain hotels. The dinner is also fantastic: a 6 to 9 course dinner every evening, exactly the right size portions so that you can enjoy each dish without getting stuffed! Once you get back from the slopes, aprox. 4 o´clock you also have a great apperitive waiting for you, including sandwiches, cold meats, cheese, cakes and much more... We choose Room type B. Fair size, nicely decorated with a bacony with a lovely view of the dolomites. We also saw some of the higher class rooms. They are obviously bigger and nicer, but If I choose to go back I wouldn´t bother paying for an unnecessary upgrade. Room was perfect! They have a wonderfull indoor-outdoor pool, surprisingly the outdoor side was much warmer thant the indoor side! They also have an enrmous wellness area, including an outside jacuzzi where we enjoyed some nise """"proseco"""" bottles. Th indoor are is only for adults and includes various sauna and turquish baths were most people are naked, but is not aproblem if you decide to keep your gear on! Staff were also really nice. Specially the people from recepcion and the waiters in the restaurant. One night were only joking when we said that the chocolate cake from the dessert buffet had finished and that we hadn't had any, so next night once we had finished dinner they brought us a hole enourmes chocolate cake just for us!!!!! All these little details make you feel really comfortable when you a traveling, speacially on a nice family ski-holiday like the one we have just bee on. The only downside of this hotel is that it does not include free wi-fi. In all fairness in only cost me 7 euros to by a 24h voucher that took me all through the week, but I still think internet should be included in all hotels.

I went with my girlfriend, her sister+husband+2 little childs, and her parents ; so people from every age. And everyone enjoyed the stay at cavallion bianco. The Kühebacher familly make this place one of the nicest place on earth. Everything is done to be like home (but much much much better). Swimming pool, Spa (amazing panoramic sauna on the roof + jacuzzi on the roof). The rooms are big, very clean in a tyrol style. The staff is very kind ! The food is great. Classic italian food with tyrol inspiration. The chef and his crew prepare every night an amazing 5 service dinner (+++ for the strudel and the gnocchetti di verde) It's an amazing place for families : children can play at the swimming pool, play billiard, go to the cinema, play bowling, .... and there is also a big play room for little children with a lot of games (2-10). So I put the maximum score for this hotel. San Candido is worth visiting, it's a very nice place to enjoy the mountains of South Tyrol. Room Tip: We took the 226 and the room is very nice.

“The best please on eath....”,"I have been travelling a lot, and this please is the one were I feel like home. The best place were you can really relax and enjoy, you come back home with so much energy after a week there. You can't get board, il cavallino bianco has everything to offer! Starting with a top location in this beautiful village, everytime we come we are so delighted! Beautiful swimmingpool with spa zone, cinemazone, bowling, billiard, and this amazing panomaric sauna and jacuzzi, you cannot get board of the view. Everything is clean, well kept, the food is just amazing! I'm so excited to go back again... We don't have children, but families are very kindly treated you just wanne go back when you have children! Everything is possible at the cavallino, just ask everyone will be helpfull and adoreble. What I olso love abouth this hotel is that it has an history, just check the paintings on the wall, the plans everything is relayted to the history of the hotel. The rooms are +++top++. An other thing I like about the cavalino is that you have lots of different spaces where you have an free acces, that's just charming because even when the hotel is full you never see all the people, it never feels crawded. This is far better than a big chain or whatever other impersonnal hotel, if you really want to enjoy your stay, get to know the people just layback and relax..... Like i said before, best place on eath!!!!",couple,POS
“Kuchebaker the best hosts!”,"since I was a child I am enjoying the warm welcome of the Cavallino Bianco's owners.the family Kuxhebacker. I do not speak german but they speak a fluent Italian. My three sons, one 40 years old by now and one only 12, have always enjoyed our holidays, both the winter and the summer ones.Actually he learned to bike in San Candido! The reason that i am always dreaming to come back is beacuse there is everything that you may want and more! swimming pool, sauna, eucalitpus bath, cinema, discoteque, bowling,ping ping, and much more! San candido is a very authentic village with exclusive stores and I alwasy enjoy the long biking from San Candido to Lienza coming back by train!",family,POS
“Relaxing break”,"Nice and very spacious hotel (rooms are very confortable and renewed mixing modern and vintage/old mountain style, reading/rea rooms, playing room with baby-sitter,complete spa, swimmingpool) staff friendly and professional, restaurant with plenty of choice but sometime quality not as good as you may expect by a 4 star. Children are really welcome but this mean not very quiet atmosphere sometime. If you are skiing facilities are not so close but pedestrian area with shops only few minute walk.",family,NEG
“Charming hotel”,"We stayed at Villa Stefania during the week of Carnival 2013. The hotel is in a quiet and pleasant location -- a five-minute walk from the pedestrian area of San Candido. San Candido does not feel like a ski resort -- which to us is a plus. The village is quaint, with lots of restaurants and shops. We were looking for a resort with lots of cross-country skiiing opportunities, and San Candido is perfect for this. Hotel Villa Stefania is comfortable and charming. We were particularly taken with the old wing, with a comfortable area for afternoon tea. The service was excellent. All the staff was friendly and efficient. The owner of the hotel organizes hikes in the area (free of charge) and we took advantage of this opportunity to discover the beautiful Lago di Braies with her (and her dog). We stayed in a family suite with two separate rooms. The suite was large and comfortable. The restaurant's cuisine was very good, with three choices for each course. One of us has food intolerances, but there was always enough choice to accommodate her. The spa area is large and pleasant to relax in. A wonderful stay!",family,POS
“Another great holiday!”,"Yet again a superb winter break at the Hotel Villa Stefania. Beautiful views, very comfortable rooms, great food and very friendly/helpful staff. The spa complex is most welcome at the end of a day's walking or skiing. The guided walks taken by Mary Ortner (the owner) are an added bonus and show you areas not normally seen by holidaymakers. We will be back!",couple,POS
“Beautiful Hotel”,"This was our second stay at the Hotel Villa Stefania, and it was just as wonderful as the first. The hotel itself is beautiful, with wonderful views of the mountains if your room looks out the back of the hotel. There is a spa facility, that is an added bonus. But the the best part is the breakfast and dinner that comes with your stay. The dinner is a multi-course event that is truely superb. We traveled with 2 other couples, and what a great conclusion to the end of a long day of shopping and sightseeing! For americans like us, the hotel and the dinning was a very upscale experience. The staff was friendly and helpful, and I would stay there again in a heartbeat.",couple,POS
“Great ski week from 18th to 25th February this year”,"Excellent hotel with delcious food and a great staff. The wellness center was fabulous! Room Tip: If you are a family of fous, ask for the family suite. Room 214 is really spacious! See more room tips",family,POS
"“A noisy, not relaxing hotel.”","I spent a week at Villa Stefania Hotel and while facilities, location and restaurant are very good, i found the rooms very very noisy. I stayed in the old part of the construction, and walls and doors were very thin, no soundproofing at all, the passage floor was made of wood, and so very noisy when children (a lot of children!) ran and when chambermaids moved trolleys and hoover. The first 3 days i stayed in a quite large room, but very noisy because i was surrounded by crying children and - above all - by the nearby rooms bathrooms (i had a water drain just behind my bed!). So I asked to change the room, and i stayed for the remaining 4 days in a smaller room, far from the children, but still very noisy because the chambermaids started to make the nearby rooms very early in the morning, talking rowdily, dragging trolleys and using hoovers without any care, and despite i had gently asked to try to make no noise at least untill 9:30 am. In short, i stayed 7 days, and i was never able to wake up spontaneously or with my alarm clock, but i was always woken up by the surrounding noise. I'm quite disappointed about that, also because this hotel is (?) a 'SilenceHotel' and a 'Charme & Relax' hotel.. but actually: NO silcence, and NO relax (just a small dose of charme)!",None,NEG
"“Expensive, but very friendly staff and good food”","We spent one night while on the road from Austria. This is a family run hotel, and the owners and staff are really nice and friendly. Our room was small, simple and clean. Dinner was very good quality. For the price we paid (150 euro for B&B and dinner), I would have expceted a slightly more upscale type of accommodation.",couple,NEG
“Excellent”,"Modern & efficient hotel in a traditional style building out of town well connected by bus. Excellent food, wonderful Spa, clean & cozy rooms. Elegantly run, without intrusiveness, by the owning couple -----------------------------------------",None,POS
“Never again”,"The hotel has a nice web site which unfortunately does not reflect what found in place. The room was much less appealing than those visible in the pictures, and there was no electricity in the room at our arrival. The position of the hotel is very unfortunate, there's nothing around apart the road and a few private farms/houses whose owners will shout on you if you try to have a walk around. The wellness center was """"not available"""" for two days (we stayed for 4 days), presumably because the owner thought that there were not enough guests to open it. The most annoying issue about this hotel was the unhospitality of the personnel, especially with the kids. No flexibility about meal time and departure time. The only positive point is a nice restaurant with good food. The room cleaning was acceptable. The conclusion is that there are many other good hotels in this area, stay away from this one.",family,NEG
“Very comfortable and delicious food!”,"The rooms are very large, clean and comfortable, great view looking out the window! During our ski trip in Val Gardena our very friendly host/owner Karin gave us considerable information about her home town area.The breakfast had a nice variety of foods - yogurt, cereals, freshly juices, Eggs, meats, cheeses, and fruit. Dinner was simply delicious! A great variety of delicious plates including typical Tyrolean food and italian specials, according the homepage description! Definitly recommendable!",couple,NEG
“meraviglioso .... come sempre”,How to say? I sometime have the lucky opportunity to return in armentarola in summer or winter time and always it is an relaxing experience. Superbe hotel and cousine in the europe most beautiful mountains landscape.,family,POS
“A wonderful hotel”,"I don't understand how Tripadvisor allows disgruntled clients a chance to hit great hotels below the belt. Toni , his staff and family do not deserve a single star just because someone thinks they can ask for a 10 day break when the hotel is normally fully booked in weekly slots each winter- and to accomodate a """"newby"""" they are expected to dislodge a long term client and lose 4 days income to boot ! Anyway I am there in september and visit from time to time each year. The restaurant is fabulous, the staff friendly and considerate. Try the steak tartare fom the menu- a dish that is also served cold just like revenge I suppose ?5 stars to rebalance a previous injustice.

“A warm mountain lodge in the Dolomites”,"Been there a while ago (August 2010) but decided only now to write an opinion. The hotel is an historic one in Alta Badia, opened some 70 years ago by the same family who runs it nowadays and modernised over time. The place has a mountain lodge feeling that makes it quite peculiar and unique. Pros: - Food was incredible, extreme quality of the ingredients, variety and quantity - Location is awesome, the hotel lies amongst woods and close to a bus station in case you don't want to drive your own car - it's about a couple of KMs from S. Cassiano - Staff was very friendly and attentive to clients' needs - Hotel grounds quite extensive and including a nice relax area at the back of the hotel and tennis court Cons: - no external swimming pool and internal one needs refurbishment - a bit noisy at dinner time (due to the fact that most of the clients now each other from a long time, so there's a lot of chatting) - Wifi not included and billed at ridicolous prices (could be included in the price of the room) All in all a safe harbour in one of the most spectacular valleys of the Dolomites",couple,NEG
